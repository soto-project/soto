Using the DescribeVoices operation you can provide the user with a list of available voices to select from.  You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available voices. For example, if you specify en-US, the operation returns a list of all available US English voices.  This operation requires permissions to perform the polly:DescribeVoices action.
