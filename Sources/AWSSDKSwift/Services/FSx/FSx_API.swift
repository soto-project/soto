Any files that FSx has already exported are not reverted.   FSx continues to export any files that are "in-flight" when the cancel operation is received.   FSx does not export any files that have not yet been exported.  
    public func cancelDataRepositoryTask(_ input: CancelDataRepositoryTaskRequest) -> EventLoopFuture<CancelDataRepositoryTaskResponse> {

    ///  Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. Creating regular backups for your file system is a best practice that complements the replication that Amazon FSx for Windows File Server performs for your file system. It also enables you to restore from user modification of data. If a backup with the specified client request token exists, and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the existing backup. If a backup specified client request token exists, and the parameters don't match, this operation returns IncompatibleParameterError. If a backup with the specified client request token doesn't exist, CreateBackup does the following:    Creates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of CREATING.   Returns the description of the backup.   By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateBackup operation without the risk of creating an extra backup. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a backup was created. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a backup, the operation returns a successful result because all the parameters are the same. The CreateFileSystem operation returns while the backup's lifecycle state is still CREATING. You can check the file system creation status by calling the DescribeBackups operation, which returns the backup state along with other information.

    ///  Creates an Amazon FSx for Lustre data repository task. You use data repository tasks to perform bulk operations between your Amazon FSx file system and its linked data repository. An example of a data repository task is exporting any data and metadata changes, including POSIX metadata, to files, directories, and symbolic links (symlinks) from your FSx file system to its linked data repository. A CreateDataRepositoryTask operation will fail if a data repository is not linked to the FSx file system. To learn more about data repository tasks, see Using Data Repository Tasks. To learn more about linking a data repository to your file system, see Setting the Export Prefix.

    ///  Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system. If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match, CreateFileSystem returns the description of the existing file system. If a file system specified client request token exists and the parameters don't match, this call returns IncompatibleParameterError. If a file system with the specified client request token doesn't exist, CreateFileSystem does the following:    Creates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of CREATING.   Returns the description of the file system.   This operation requires a client request token in the request that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent creation. This means that calling the operation multiple times with the same client request token has no effect. By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateFileSystem operation without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client receives success as long as the parameters are the same.  The CreateFileSystem call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still CREATING. You can check the file-system creation status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns the file system state along with other information.

If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the file system. If a client request token specified by the file system exists and the parameters don't match, this call returns IncompatibleParameterError. If a file system with the specified client request token doesn't exist, this operation does the following:   Creates a new Amazon FSx file system from backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of CREATING.   Returns the description of the file system.   Parameters like Active Directory, default share name, automatic backup, and backup settings default to the parameters of the file system that was backed up, unless overridden. You can explicitly supply other settings. By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateFileSystemFromBackup call without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset.

By default, when you delete an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, a final backup is created upon deletion. This final backup is not subject to the file system's retention policy, and must be manually deleted. The DeleteFileSystem action returns while the file system has the DELETING status. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the DescribeFileSystems action, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass the file system ID for a deleted file system, the DescribeFileSystems returns a FileSystemNotFound error.  Deleting an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system will fail with a 400 BadRequest if a data repository task is in a PENDING or EXECUTING state.   The data in a deleted file system is also deleted and can't be recovered by any means.

Then the action continues to be called with the NextToken parameter set to the value of the last NextToken value until a response has no NextToken. When using this action, keep the following in mind:   The implementation might return fewer than MaxResults file system descriptions while still including a NextToken value.

Otherwise, it returns all data repository tasks owned by your AWS account in the AWS Region of the endpoint that you're calling. When retrieving all tasks, you can paginate the response by using the optional MaxResults parameter to limit the number of tasks returned in a response.
