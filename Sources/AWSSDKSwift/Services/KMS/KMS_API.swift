/**
AWS Key Management Service AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide .  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS. Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.  Signing Requests  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user, or you can use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests. All AWS KMS operations require Signature Version 4.  Logging API Requests  AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.  Additional Resources  For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:    AWS Security Credentials - This topic provides general information about the of credentials used for accessing AWS.    Temporary Security Credentials - This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.    Signature Version 4 Signing Process - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.    Commonly Used APIs  Of the APIs discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform actions other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.    Encrypt     Decrypt     GenerateDataKey     GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext

The custom key store must be connected before you can create customer master keys (CMKs) in the key store or use the CMKs it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time. To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the CreateHsm operation. The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the  kmsuser crypto user (CU), and rotates its password. The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the ConnectionErrorCode in the response. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry. To fix the failure, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use ConnectCustomKeyStore again. If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

    ///  Creates a display name for a customer master key (CMK). You can use an alias to identify a CMK in selected operations, such as Encrypt and GenerateDataKey.  Each CMK can have multiple aliases, but each alias points to only one CMK. The alias name must be unique in the AWS account and region. To simplify code that runs in multiple regions, use the same alias name, but point it to a different CMK in each region.  Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs, use the ListAliases operation. An alias must start with the word alias followed by a forward slash (alias/). The alias name can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). Alias names cannot begin with aws; that alias name prefix is reserved by Amazon Web Services (AWS). The alias and the CMK it is mapped to must be in the same AWS account and the same region. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account. To map an existing alias to a different CMK, call UpdateAlias. The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

This operation is part of the Custom Key Store feature feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store. When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the new custom key store. Before you can use your new custom key store, you need to use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect the new key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster. The CreateCustomKeyStore operation requires the following elements.   You must specify an active AWS CloudHSM cluster in the same account and AWS Region as the custom key store. You can use an existing cluster or create and activate a new AWS CloudHSM cluster for the key store. AWS KMS does not require exclusive use of the cluster.   You must include the content of the trust anchor certificate for the cluster. You created this certificate, and saved it in the customerCA.crt file, when you initialized the cluster.   You must provide the password of the dedicated  kmsuser crypto user (CU) account in the cluster. Before you create the custom key store, use the createUser command in cloudhsm_mgmt_util to create a crypto user (CU) named kmsuser in specified AWS CloudHSM cluster. AWS KMS uses the kmsuser CU account to create and manage key material on your behalf. For instructions, see Create the kmsuser Crypto User in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.   The AWS CloudHSM cluster that you specify must meet the following requirements.   The cluster must be active and be in the same AWS account and Region as the custom key store.   Each custom key store must be associated with a different AWS CloudHSM cluster. The cluster cannot be associated with another custom key store or have the same cluster certificate as a cluster that is associated with another custom key store. To view the cluster certificate, use the AWS CloudHSM DescribeClusters operation. Clusters that share a backup history have the same cluster certificate.   The cluster must be configured with subnets in at least two different Availability Zones in the Region. Because AWS CloudHSM is not supported in all Availability Zones, we recommend that the cluster have subnets in all Availability Zones in the Region.   The cluster must contain at least two active HSMs, each in a different Availability Zone.   New custom key stores are not automatically connected. After you create your custom key store, use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect the custom key store to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. Even if you are not going to use your custom key store immediately, you might want to connect it to verify that all settings are correct and then disconnect it until you are ready to use it. If this operation succeeds, it returns the ID of the new custom key store. For help with failures, see Troubleshoot a Custom Key Store in the AWS KMS Developer Guide.

For more information about data keys and the difference between CMKs and data keys, see the following:   The GenerateDataKey operation    AWS Key Management Service Concepts in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide    If you plan to import key material, use the Origin parameter with a value of EXTERNAL to create a CMK with no key material. To create a CMK in a custom key store, use CustomKeyStoreId parameter to specify the custom key store. You must also use the Origin parameter with a value of AWS_CLOUDHSM. The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least two active HSMs, each in a different Availability Zone in the Region. You cannot use this operation to create a CMK in a different AWS account.

To remedy this, we recommend that you do not grant Decrypt access in an IAM user policy. Instead grant Decrypt access only in key policies. If you must grant Decrypt access in an IAM user policy, you should scope the resource to specific keys or to specific trusted accounts.

The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs). Before deleting the key store, verify that you will never need to use any of the CMKs in the key store for any cryptographic operations. Then, use ScheduleKeyDeletion to delete the AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) from the key store. When the scheduled waiting period expires, the ScheduleKeyDeletion operation deletes the CMKs. Then it makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. After all CMKs are deleted from AWS KMS, use DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect the key store from AWS KMS. Then, you can delete the custom key store. Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect it from AWS KMS. While the key store is disconnected, you cannot create or use the CMKs in the key store. But, you do not need to delete CMKs and you can reconnect a disconnected custom key store at any time.

To get only information about a particular custom key store, use either the CustomKeyStoreName or CustomKeyStoreId parameter (but not both). To determine whether the custom key store is connected to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, use the ConnectionState element in the response. If an attempt to connect the custom key store failed, the ConnectionState value is FAILED and the ConnectionErrorCode element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry. Custom key stores have a DISCONNECTED connection state if the key store has never been connected or you use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. If your custom key store state is CONNECTED but you are having trouble using it, make sure that its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster is active and contains the minimum number of HSMs required for the operation, if any.

The Encrypt operation has two primary use cases:   You can encrypt up to 4 kilobytes (4096 bytes) of arbitrary data such as an RSA key, a database password, or other sensitive information.   To move encrypted data from one AWS region to another, you can use this operation to encrypt in the new region the plaintext data key that was used to encrypt the data in the original region. This provides you with an encrypted copy of the data key that can be decrypted in the new region and used there to decrypt the encrypted data.   To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter. Unless you are moving encrypted data from one region to another, you don't use this operation to encrypt a generated data key within a region. To get data keys that are already encrypted, call the GenerateDataKey or GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext operation. Data keys don't need to be encrypted again by calling Encrypt. To encrypt data locally in your application, use the GenerateDataKey operation to return a plaintext data encryption key and a copy of the key encrypted under the CMK of your choosing.

You must also specify the length of the data key using either the KeySpec or NumberOfBytes field. You must specify one field or the other, but not both. For common key lengths (128-bit and 256-bit symmetric keys), we recommend that you use KeySpec. To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter. This operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key in the Plaintext field of the response, and an encrypted copy of the data key in the CiphertextBlob field. The data key is encrypted under the CMK specified in the KeyId field of the request.  We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your application:   Use this operation (GenerateDataKey) to get a data encryption key.   Use the plaintext data encryption key (returned in the Plaintext field of the response) to encrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.   Store the encrypted data key (returned in the CiphertextBlob field of the response) alongside the locally encrypted data.   To decrypt data locally:   Use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key into a plaintext copy of the data key.   Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.   To return only an encrypted copy of the data key, use GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext. To return a random byte string that is cryptographically secure, use GenerateRandom. If you use the optional EncryptionContext field, you must store at least enough information to be able to reconstruct the full encryption context when you later send the ciphertext to the Decrypt operation. It is a good practice to choose an encryption context that you can reconstruct on the fly to better secure the ciphertext. For more information, see Encryption Context in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK.

For more information about creating CMKs with no key material and then importing key material, see Importing Key Material in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. Before using this operation, call GetParametersForImport. Its response includes a public key and an import token. Use the public key to encrypt the key material. Then, submit the import token from the same GetParametersForImport response. When calling this operation, you must specify the following values:   The key ID or key ARN of a CMK with no key material. Its Origin must be EXTERNAL. To create a CMK with no key material, call CreateKey and set the value of its Origin parameter to EXTERNAL. To get the Origin of a CMK, call DescribeKey.)

This token and the public key used to encrypt the key material must have come from the same response.   Whether the key material expires and if so, when. If you set an expiration date, you can change it only by reimporting the same key material and specifying a new expiration date. If the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material and the CMK becomes unusable. To use the CMK again, you must reimport the same key material.   When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes from PendingImport to Enabled, and you can use the CMK. After you successfully import key material into a CMK, you can reimport the same key material into that CMK, but you cannot import different key material. The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

Unlike other operations, ReEncrypt is authorized twice, once as ReEncryptFrom on the source CMK and once as ReEncryptTo on the destination CMK. We recommend that you include the "kms:ReEncrypt*" permission in your key policies to permit reencryption from or to the CMK.

Before the waiting period ends, you can use CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the CMK. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK and all AWS KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.  Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is unrecoverable. To prevent the use of a CMK without deleting it, use DisableKey.  If you schedule deletion of a CMK from a custom key store, when the waiting period expires, ScheduleKeyDeletion deletes the CMK from AWS KMS.

However, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account. For more information about scheduling a CMK for deletion, see Deleting Customer Master Keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account. This operation works only on existing aliases. To change the alias of a CMK to a new value, use CreateAlias to create a new alias and DeleteAlias to delete the old alias. Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can create, update, and delete the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs in the account, use the ListAliases operation.  An alias name can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). An alias must start with the word alias followed by a forward slash (alias/).

You can use this parameter to fix connection failures that occur when AWS KMS cannot log into the associated cluster because the kmsuser password has changed. This value does not change the password in the AWS CloudHSM cluster. Use the CloudHsmClusterId parameter to associate the custom key store with a related AWS CloudHSM cluster, that is, a cluster that shares a backup history with the original cluster. You can use this parameter to repair a custom key store if its AWS CloudHSM cluster becomes corrupted or is deleted, or when you need to create or restore a cluster from a backup. The cluster ID must identify a AWS CloudHSM cluster with the following requirements.   The cluster must be active and be in the same AWS account and Region as the custom key store.   The cluster must have the same cluster certificate as the original cluster. You cannot use this parameter to associate the custom key store with an unrelated cluster. To view the cluster certificate, use the AWS CloudHSM DescribeClusters operation. Clusters that share a backup history have the same cluster certificate.   The cluster must be configured with subnets in at least two different Availability Zones in the Region. Because AWS CloudHSM is not supported in all Availability Zones, we recommend that the cluster have subnets in all Availability Zones in the Region.   The cluster must contain at least two active HSMs, each in a different Availability Zone.   If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.
