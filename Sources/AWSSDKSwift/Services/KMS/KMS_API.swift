/**
Client object for interacting with AWS KMS service.

AWS Key Management Service AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide .  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS. Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.  Signing Requests  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests. All AWS KMS operations require Signature Version 4.  Logging API Requests  AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.  Additional Resources  For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:    AWS Security Credentials - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used for accessing AWS.    Temporary Security Credentials - This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.    Signature Version 4 Signing Process - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.    Commonly Used API Operations  Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.

You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account. For more information about scheduling and canceling deletion of a CMK, see Deleting Customer Master Keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

    ///  Connects or reconnects a custom key store to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. The custom key store must be connected before you can create customer master keys (CMKs) in the key store or use the CMKs it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time. To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the CreateHsm operation. Also, the  kmsuser crypto user (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from using this account to log in. The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the kmsuser CU, and rotates its password. The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the ConnectionErrorCode in the response. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry. To fix the failure, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use ConnectCustomKeyStore again. If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

    ///  Creates a display name for a customer managed customer master key (CMK). You can use an alias to identify a CMK in cryptographic operations, such as Encrypt and GenerateDataKey. You can change the CMK associated with the alias at any time. Aliases are easier to remember than key IDs. They can also help to simplify your applications. For example, if you use an alias in your code, you can change the CMK your code uses by associating a given alias with a different CMK.  To run the same code in multiple AWS regions, use an alias in your code, such as alias/ApplicationKey. Then, in each AWS Region, create an alias/ApplicationKey alias that is associated with a CMK in that Region. When you run your code, it uses the alias/ApplicationKey CMK for that AWS Region without any Region-specific code. This operation does not return a response. To get the alias that you created, use the ListAliases operation. To use aliases successfully, be aware of the following information.   Each alias points to only one CMK at a time, although a single CMK can have multiple aliases. The alias and its associated CMK must be in the same AWS account and Region.    You can associate an alias with any customer managed CMK in the same AWS account and Region. However, you do not have permission to associate an alias with an AWS managed CMK or an AWS owned CMK.    To change the CMK associated with an alias, use the UpdateAlias operation. The current CMK and the new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric) and they must have the same key usage (ENCRYPT_DECRYPT or SIGN_VERIFY). This restriction prevents cryptographic errors in code that uses aliases.   The alias name must begin with alias/ followed by a name, such as alias/ExampleAlias. It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with alias/aws/. The alias/aws/ prefix is reserved for AWS managed CMKs.    The alias name must be unique within an AWS Region. However, you can use the same alias name in multiple Regions of the same AWS account. Each instance of the alias is associated with a CMK in its Region.   After you create an alias, you cannot change its alias name. However, you can use the DeleteAlias operation to delete the alias and then create a new alias with the desired name.   You can use an alias name or alias ARN to identify a CMK in AWS KMS cryptographic operations and in the DescribeKey operation. However, you cannot use alias names or alias ARNs in API operations that manage CMKs, such as DisableKey or GetKeyPolicy. For information about the valid CMK identifiers for each AWS KMS API operation, see the descriptions of the KeyId parameter in the API operation documentation.   Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases and alias ARNs of CMKs in each AWS account and Region, use the ListAliases operation. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

This operation is part of the Custom Key Store feature feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store. Before you create the custom key store, you must assemble the required elements, including an AWS CloudHSM cluster that fulfills the requirements for a custom key store. For details about the required elements, see Assemble the Prerequisites in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the new custom key store. Before you can use your new custom key store, you need to use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect the new key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster. Even if you are not going to use your custom key store immediately, you might want to connect it to verify that all settings are correct and then disconnect it until you are ready to use it. For help with failures, see Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

    ///  Adds a grant to a customer master key (CMK). The grant allows the grantee principal to use the CMK when the conditions specified in the grant are met. When setting permissions, grants are an alternative to key policies.  To create a grant that allows a cryptographic operation only when the request includes a particular encryption context, use the Constraints parameter. For details, see GrantConstraints. You can create grants on symmetric and asymmetric CMKs. However, if the grant allows an operation that the CMK does not support, CreateGrant fails with a ValidationException.    Grants for symmetric CMKs cannot allow operations that are not supported for symmetric CMKs, including Sign, Verify, and GetPublicKey. (There are limited exceptions to this rule for legacy operations, but you should not create a grant for an operation that AWS KMS does not support.)   Grants for asymmetric CMKs cannot allow operations that are not supported for asymmetric CMKs, including operations that generate data keys or data key pairs, or operations related to automatic key rotation, imported key material, or CMKs in custom key stores.   Grants for asymmetric CMKs with a KeyUsage of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT cannot allow the Sign or Verify operations. Grants for asymmetric CMKs with a KeyUsage of SIGN_VERIFY cannot allow the Encrypt or Decrypt operations.   Grants for asymmetric CMKs cannot include an encryption context grant constraint. An encryption context is not supported on asymmetric CMKs.   For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter. For more information about grants, see Grants in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

    }

    ///  Creates a unique customer managed customer master key (CMK) in your AWS account and Region. You cannot use this operation to create a CMK in a different AWS account. You can use the CreateKey operation to create symmetric or asymmetric CMKs.    Symmetric CMKs contain a 256-bit symmetric key that never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. To use the CMK, you must call AWS KMS. You can use a symmetric CMK to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they are typically used to generate data keys and data keys pairs. For details, see GenerateDataKey and GenerateDataKeyPair.    Asymmetric CMKs can contain an RSA key pair or an Elliptic Curve (ECC) key pair. The private key in an asymmetric CMK never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key so it can be used outside of AWS KMS. CMKs with RSA key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but not both). CMKs with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and verify messages.   For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. To create different types of CMKs, use the following guidance:  Asymmetric CMKs  To create an asymmetric CMK, use the CustomerMasterKeySpec parameter to specify the type of key material in the CMK. Then, use the KeyUsage parameter to determine whether the CMK will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change these properties after the CMK is created.    Symmetric CMKs  When creating a symmetric CMK, you don't need to specify the CustomerMasterKeySpec or KeyUsage parameters. The default value for CustomerMasterKeySpec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, and the default value for KeyUsage, ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, are the only valid values for symmetric CMKs.     Imported Key Material  To import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric CMK with no key material. To do this, use the Origin parameter of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL. Next, use GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and import token, and use the public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use ImportKeyMaterial with your import token to import the key material. For step-by-step instructions, see Importing Key Material in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . You cannot import the key material into an asymmetric CMK.    Custom Key Stores  To create a symmetric CMK in a custom key store, use the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to specify the custom key store. You must also use the Origin parameter with a value of AWS_CLOUDHSM. The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the AWS Region.  You cannot create an asymmetric CMK in a custom key store. For information about custom key stores in AWS KMS see Using Custom Key Stores in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide .  
    public func createKey(_ input: CreateKeyRequest) -> EventLoopFuture<CreateKeyResponse> {
        return client.send(operation: "CreateKey", path: "/", httpMethod: "POST", input: input)
    }

    ///  Decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted by a AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) using any of the following operations:    Encrypt     GenerateDataKey     GenerateDataKeyPair     GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext     GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext    You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted under a symmetric or asymmetric CMK. When the CMK is asymmetric, you must specify the CMK and the encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of AWS KMS by the public key in an AWS KMS asymmetric CMK. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, you do not need to specify the CMK or the encryption algorithm. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. However, if you prefer, you can specify the KeyId to ensure that a particular CMK is used to decrypt the ciphertext. If you specify a different CMK than the one used to encrypt the ciphertext, the Decrypt operation fails. Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the Decrypt operation on a particular CMK, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user Decrypt permission on all CMKs. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by CMKs in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account CMK permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for Decrypt permissions, limit the user to particular CMKs or particular trusted accounts. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

To get the aliases of all CMKs, use the ListAliases operation.  Each CMK can have multiple aliases.

The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs). Before deleting the key store, verify that you will never need to use any of the CMKs in the key store for any cryptographic operations. Then, use ScheduleKeyDeletion to delete the AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) from the key store. When the scheduled waiting period expires, the ScheduleKeyDeletion operation deletes the CMKs. Then it makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. After all CMKs are deleted from AWS KMS, use DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect the key store from AWS KMS. Then, you can delete the custom key store. Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect it from AWS KMS. While the key store is disconnected, you cannot create or use the CMKs in the key store. But, you do not need to delete CMKs and you can reconnect a disconnected custom key store at any time. If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.

To get only information about a particular custom key store, use either the CustomKeyStoreName or CustomKeyStoreId parameter (but not both). To determine whether the custom key store is connected to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, use the ConnectionState element in the response. If an attempt to connect the custom key store failed, the ConnectionState value is FAILED and the ConnectionErrorCode element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry. Custom key stores have a DISCONNECTED connection state if the key store has never been connected or you use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. If your custom key store state is CONNECTED but you are having trouble using it, make sure that its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster is active and contains the minimum number of HSMs required for the operation, if any.

Then, in the new region, call the Encrypt method on same plaintext data key. Now, you can safely move the encrypted data and encrypted data key to the new region, and decrypt in the new region when necessary.   You don't need to use the Encrypt operation to encrypt a data key. The GenerateDataKey and GenerateDataKeyPair operations return a plaintext data key and an encrypted copy of that data key. When you encrypt data, you must specify a symmetric or asymmetric CMK to use in the encryption operation. The CMK must have a KeyUsage value of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT. To find the KeyUsage of a CMK, use the DescribeKey operation.  If you use a symmetric CMK, you can use an encryption context to add additional security to your encryption operation. If you specify an EncryptionContext when encrypting data, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the data. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. If you specify an asymmetric CMK, you must also specify the encryption algorithm. The algorithm must be compatible with the CMK type.  When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails. You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.  The maximum size of the data that you can encrypt varies with the type of CMK and the encryption algorithm that you choose.

For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key within AWS KMS by calling the Encrypt, ReEncrypt, or Verify operations with the identifier of an asymmetric CMK.

You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted. These features are not effective outside of AWS KMS. For details, see Special Considerations for Downloading Public Keys. To help you use the public key safely outside of AWS KMS, GetPublicKey returns important information about the public key in the response, including:    CustomerMasterKeySpec: The type of key material in the public key, such as RSA_4096 or ECC_NIST_P521.

Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair, such as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric customer master key (CMK). The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key to sign a message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the message was signed with that particular private key and that the message hasn't changed since it was signed.  To use the Sign operation, provide the following information:   Use the KeyId parameter to identify an asymmetric CMK with a KeyUsage value of SIGN_VERIFY. To get the KeyUsage value of a CMK, use the DescribeKey operation. The caller must have kms:Sign permission on the CMK.   Use the Message parameter to specify the message or message digest to sign.

To indicate whether the message is a full message or a digest, use the MessageType parameter.   Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the CMK.     When signing a message, be sure to record the CMK and the signing algorithm. This information is required to verify the signature.

The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

    ///  Removes the specified tags from the specified customer master key (CMK). You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account. To remove a tag, specify the tag key. To change the tag value of an existing tag key, use TagResource. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

    ///  Associates an existing AWS KMS alias with a different customer master key (CMK). Each alias is associated with only one CMK at a time, although a CMK can have multiple aliases. The alias and the CMK must be in the same AWS account and region. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account.  The current and new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric), and they must have the same key usage (ENCRYPT_DECRYPT or SIGN_VERIFY). This restriction prevents errors in code that uses aliases. If you must assign an alias to a different type of CMK, use DeleteAlias to delete the old alias and CreateAlias to create a new alias. You cannot use UpdateAlias to change an alias name. To change an alias name, use DeleteAlias to delete the old alias and CreateAlias to create a new alias. Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can create, update, and delete the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs in the account, use the ListAliases operation.  The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

    ///  Changes the properties of a custom key store. Use the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to identify the custom key store you want to edit. Use the remaining parameters to change the properties of the custom key store. You can only update a custom key store that is disconnected. To disconnect the custom key store, use DisconnectCustomKeyStore. To reconnect the custom key store after the update completes, use ConnectCustomKeyStore. To find the connection state of a custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. Use the parameters of UpdateCustomKeyStore to edit your keystore settings.   Use the NewCustomKeyStoreName parameter to change the friendly name of the custom key store to the value that you specify.     Use the KeyStorePassword parameter tell AWS KMS the current password of the  kmsuser crypto user (CU) in the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. You can use this parameter to fix connection failures that occur when AWS KMS cannot log into the associated cluster because the kmsuser password has changed. This value does not change the password in the AWS CloudHSM cluster.     Use the CloudHsmClusterId parameter to associate the custom key store with a different, but related, AWS CloudHSM cluster. You can use this parameter to repair a custom key store if its AWS CloudHSM cluster becomes corrupted or is deleted, or when you need to create or restore a cluster from a backup.    If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties. This operation is part of the Custom Key Store feature feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

    ///  Verifies a digital signature that was generated by the Sign operation.   Verification confirms that an authorized user signed the message with the specified CMK and signing algorithm, and the message hasn't changed since it was signed. If the signature is verified, the value of the SignatureValid field in the response is True. If the signature verification fails, the Verify operation fails with an KMSInvalidSignatureException exception. A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric CMK. The signature is verified by using the public key in the same asymmetric CMK. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. To verify a digital signature, you can use the Verify operation. Specify the same asymmetric CMK, message, and signing algorithm that were used to produce the signature. You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the CMK outside of AWS KMS. Use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key in the asymmetric CMK and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of AWS KMS. The advantage of using the Verify operation is that it is performed within AWS KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is performed within the FIPS boundary, it is logged in AWS CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the CMK to verify signatures. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.
