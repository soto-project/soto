/**
AWS Key Management Service AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide .  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS. Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.  Signing Requests  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests. All AWS KMS operations require Signature Version 4.  Logging API Requests  AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.  Additional Resources  For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:    AWS Security Credentials - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used for accessing AWS.    Temporary Security Credentials - This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.    Signature Version 4 Signing Process - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.    Commonly Used API Operations  Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.

The custom key store must be connected before you can create customer master keys (CMKs) in the key store or use the CMKs it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time. To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the CreateHsm operation. The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the  kmsuser crypto user (CU), and rotates its password. The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the ConnectionErrorCode in the response. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry. To fix the failure, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use ConnectCustomKeyStore again. If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

Each CMK can have multiple aliases, but each alias points to only one CMK. The alias name must be unique in the AWS account and region. To simplify code that runs in multiple regions, use the same alias name, but point it to a different CMK in each region.  Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs, use the ListAliases operation. The alias name must begin with alias/ followed by a name, such as alias/ExampleAlias. It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with alias/aws/. The alias/aws/ prefix is reserved for AWS managed CMKs.  The alias and the CMK it is mapped to must be in the same AWS account and the same region. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account. To map an existing alias to a different CMK, call UpdateAlias.

Before you create the custom key store, you must assemble the required elements, including an AWS CloudHSM cluster that fulfills the requirements for a custom key store. For details about the required elements, see Assemble the Prerequisites in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the new custom key store. Before you can use your new custom key store, you need to use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect the new key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster. Even if you are not going to use your custom key store immediately, you might want to connect it to verify that all settings are correct and then disconnect it until you are ready to use it.

Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user Decrypt permission on all CMKs. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by CMKs in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account CMK permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for Decrypt permissions, limit the user to particular CMKs or particular trusted accounts. The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK.

The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs). Before deleting the key store, verify that you will never need to use any of the CMKs in the key store for any cryptographic operations. Then, use ScheduleKeyDeletion to delete the AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) from the key store. When the scheduled waiting period expires, the ScheduleKeyDeletion operation deletes the CMKs. Then it makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. After all CMKs are deleted from AWS KMS, use DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect the key store from AWS KMS. Then, you can delete the custom key store. Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect it from AWS KMS. While the key store is disconnected, you cannot create or use the CMKs in the key store. But, you do not need to delete CMKs and you can reconnect a disconnected custom key store at any time. If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties. This operation is part of the Custom Key Store feature feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store.

To get only information about a particular custom key store, use either the CustomKeyStoreName or CustomKeyStoreId parameter (but not both). To determine whether the custom key store is connected to its AWS CloudHSM cluster, use the ConnectionState element in the response. If an attempt to connect the custom key store failed, the ConnectionState value is FAILED and the ConnectionErrorCode element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry. Custom key stores have a DISCONNECTED connection state if the key store has never been connected or you use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. If your custom key store state is CONNECTED but you are having trouble using it, make sure that its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster is active and contains the minimum number of HSMs required for the operation, if any.

The Encrypt operation has two primary use cases:   You can encrypt up to 4 kilobytes (4096 bytes) of arbitrary data such as an RSA key, a database password, or other sensitive information.   You can use the Encrypt operation to move encrypted data from one AWS region to another. In the first region, generate a data key and use the plaintext key to encrypt the data. Then, in the new region, call the Encrypt method on same plaintext data key. Now, you can safely move the encrypted data and encrypted data key to the new region, and decrypt in the new region when necessary.   You don't need use this operation to encrypt a data key within a region. The GenerateDataKey and GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext operations return an encrypted data key. Also, you don't need to use this operation to encrypt data in your application. You can use the plaintext and encrypted data keys that the GenerateDataKey operation returns. The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

You can use the plaintext key to encrypt your data outside of KMS and store the encrypted data key with the encrypted data.  GenerateDataKey returns a unique data key for each request. The bytes in the key are not related to the caller or CMK that is used to encrypt the data key. To generate a data key, you need to specify the customer master key (CMK) that will be used to encrypt the data key. You must also specify the length of the data key using either the KeySpec or NumberOfBytes field (but not both). For common key lengths (128-bit and 256-bit symmetric keys), we recommend that you use KeySpec. To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter. You will find the plaintext copy of the data key in the Plaintext field of the response, and the encrypted copy of the data key in the CiphertextBlob field. We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your application:   Use the GenerateDataKey operation to get a data encryption key.   Use the plaintext data key (returned in the Plaintext field of the response) to encrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.   Store the encrypted data key (returned in the CiphertextBlob field of the response) alongside the locally encrypted data.   To decrypt data locally:   Use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key. The operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key.   Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.   To get only an encrypted copy of the data key, use GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext. To get a cryptographically secure random byte string, use GenerateRandom. You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to your encryption operation. When you specify an EncryptionContext in the GenerateDataKey operation, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) in your request to Decrypt the data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

This operation is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some point, but not immediately. When you need to encrypt the data, you call the Decrypt operation on the encrypted copy of the key. It's also useful in distributed systems with different levels of trust. For example, you might store encrypted data in containers. One component of your system creates new containers and stores an encrypted data key with each container. Then, a different component puts the data into the containers. That component first decrypts the data key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt data, puts the encrypted data into the container, and then destroys the plaintext data key.

When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes from PendingImport to Enabled, and you can use the CMK. After you successfully import key material into a CMK, you can reimport the same key material into that CMK, but you cannot import different key material. The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK. For details, see How Key State Affects Use of a Customer Master Key in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

The ListAliases response can include aliases that you created and associated with your customer managed CMKs, and aliases that AWS created and associated with AWS managed CMKs in your account. You can recognize AWS aliases because their names have the format aws/&lt;service-name&gt;, such as aws/dynamodb. The response might also include aliases that have no TargetKeyId field.

Unlike other operations, ReEncrypt is authorized twice, once as ReEncryptFrom on the source CMK and once as ReEncryptTo on the destination CMK. We recommend that you include the "kms:ReEncrypt*" permission in your key policies to permit reencryption from or to the CMK. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you create a CMK through the console. But you must include it manually when you create a CMK programmatically or when you set a key policy with the PutKeyPolicy operation.

If you do not provide a waiting period, the default period of 30 days is used. When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes to PendingDeletion. Before the waiting period ends, you can use CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the CMK. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK and all AWS KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.  Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is unrecoverable. To prevent the use of a CMK without deleting it, use DisableKey.  If you schedule deletion of a CMK from a custom key store, when the waiting period expires, ScheduleKeyDeletion deletes the CMK from AWS KMS. Then AWS KMS makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account. For more information about scheduling a CMK for deletion, see Deleting Customer Master Keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account. This operation works only on existing aliases. To change the alias of a CMK to a new value, use CreateAlias to create a new alias and DeleteAlias to delete the old alias. Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can create, update, and delete the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs in the account, use the ListAliases operation.  The alias name must begin with alias/ followed by a name, such as alias/ExampleAlias. It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_), and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with alias/aws/. The alias/aws/ prefix is reserved for AWS managed CMKs.  The result of this operation varies with the key state of the CMK.
