/**
AWS Organizations API Reference AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple AWS accounts into an organization and centrally manage your accounts and their resources. This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations API. For more information about using this service, see the AWS Organizations User Guide.  API Version  This version of the Organizations API Reference documents the Organizations API version 2016-11-28.  As an alternative to using the API directly, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, and more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Organizations. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Organizations. However, you also can use the Organizations Query API to make direct calls to the Organizations web service. To learn more about the Organizations Query API, see Making Query Requests in the AWS Organizations User Guide. Organizations supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.  Signing Requests  When you send HTTP requests to AWS, you must sign the requests so that AWS can identify who sent them. You sign requests with your AWS access key, which consists of an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not create an access key for your root account. Anyone who has the access key for your root account has unrestricted access to all the resources in your account. Instead, create an access key for an IAM user account that has administrative privileges. As another option, use AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials, and use those credentials to sign requests.  To sign requests, we recommend that you use Signature Version 4. If you have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some operations now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations that require version 4 indicate this requirement.  When you use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs to make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests for you with the access key that you specify when you configure the tools. In this release, each organization can have only one root. In a future release, a single organization will support multiple roots.  Support and Feedback for AWS Organizations  We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com or post your feedback and questions in the AWS Organizations support forum. For more information about the AWS support forums, see Forums Help.  Endpoint to Call When Using the CLI or the AWS API  For the current release of Organizations, you must specify the us-east-1 region for all AWS API and CLI calls. You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:   Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its region:  --endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com    Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command:  aws configure set default.region us-east-1    Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint:  --region us-east-1    For the various SDKs used to call the APIs, see the documentation for the SDK of interest to learn how to direct the requests to a specific endpoint. For more information, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.   How examples are presented  The JSON returned by the AWS Organizations service as response to your requests is returned as a single long string without line breaks or formatting whitespace. Both line breaks and whitespace are included in the examples in this guide to improve readability. When example input parameters also would result in long strings that would extend beyond the screen, we insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON text string.  Recording API Requests  AWS Organizations supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which requests were successfully made to Organizations, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about AWS Organizations and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see Logging AWS Organizations Events with AWS CloudTrail in the AWS Organizations User Guide. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.

    ///  Attaches a policy to a root, an organizational unit (OU), or an individual account. How the policy affects accounts depends on the type of policy:    Service control policy (SCP) - An SCP specifies what permissions can be delegated to users in affected member accounts. The scope of influence for a policy depends on what you attach the policy to:   If you attach an SCP to a root, it affects all accounts in the organization.   If you attach an SCP to an OU, it affects all accounts in that OU and in any child OUs.   If you attach the policy directly to an account, it affects only that account.   SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit (OU). You can attach one SCP to a higher level root or OU, and a different SCP to a child OU or to an account. The child policy can further restrict only the permissions that pass through the parent filter and are available to the child. An SCP that is attached to a child can't grant a permission that the parent hasn't already granted. For example, imagine that the parent SCP allows permissions A, B, C, D, and E. The child SCP allows C, D, E, F, and G. The result is that the accounts affected by the child SCP are allowed to use only C, D, and E. They can't use A or B because the child OU filtered them out. They also can't use F and G because the parent OU filtered them out. They can't be granted back by the child SCP; child SCPs can only filter the permissions they receive from the parent SCP. AWS Organizations attaches a default SCP named "FullAWSAccess to every root, OU, and account. This default SCP allows all services and actions, enabling any new child OU or account to inherit the permissions of the parent root or OU. If you detach the default policy, you must replace it with a policy that specifies the permissions that you want to allow in that OU or account. For more information about how AWS Organizations policies permissions work, see Using Service Control Policies in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

To check the status of the request, do one of the following:   Use the OperationId response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.   Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with AWS Organizations, see Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     The user who calls the API to create an account must have the organizations:CreateAccount permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, AWS Organizations creates the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User Guide. AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named OrganizationAccountAccessRole by default) that grants users in the master account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the master account can assume the role. AWS Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization's master account. This operation can be called only from the organization's master account. For more information about creating accounts, see Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is not automatically collected. If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at  To leave an organization as a member account in the AWS Organizations User Guide.   If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact AWS Support.   If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact AWS Support.   Using CreateAccount to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost Management Console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see Closing an AWS Account in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an account, see Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools.

You already have an account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region that is associated with your master account in the commercial Region.    You call this action from the master account of your organization in the commercial Region.   You have the organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount permission. AWS Organizations creates the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User Guide.    AWS automatically enables AWS CloudTrail for AWS GovCloud (US) accounts, but you should also do the following:   Verify that AWS CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.   Create an S3 bucket for AWS CloudTrail log storage. For more information, see Verifying AWS CloudTrail Is Enabled in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.    You call this action from the master account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone AWS account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the master account of an organization in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see AWS Organizations in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.  Calling CreateGovCloudAccount is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background.

To check the status of the request, do one of the following:   Use the OperationId response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.   Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with Organizations, see Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     When you call the CreateGovCloudAccount action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address. A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the master account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An AWS GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is created in the new AWS GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the AWS GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the master account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that explains how account access works, see AWS Organizations in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.
