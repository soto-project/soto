Consider the following examples:   For example, a user might utter an intent ("I want to order a pizza"). If Amazon Lex cannot infer the user intent from this utterance, it will return this dialog state.     ConfirmIntent - Amazon Lex is expecting a "yes" or "no" response.  For example, Amazon Lex wants user confirmation before fulfilling an intent. Instead of a simple "yes" or "no" response, a user might respond with additional information. For example, "yes, but make it a thick crust pizza" or "no, I want to order a drink." Amazon Lex can process such additional information (in these examples, update the crust type slot or change the intent from OrderPizza to OrderDrink).     ElicitSlot - Amazon Lex is expecting the value of a slot for the current intent.   For example, suppose that in the response Amazon Lex sends this message: "What size pizza would you like?". A user might reply with the slot value (e.g., "medium"). The user might also provide additional information in the response (e.g., "medium thick crust pizza"). Amazon Lex can process such additional information appropriately.     Fulfilled - Conveys that the Lambda function has successfully fulfilled the intent.     ReadyForFulfillment - Conveys that the client has to fulfill the request.     Failed - Conveys that the conversation with the user failed.

For example, if Amazon Lex isn't able to understand user input, it uses a clarification prompt message. When you create an intent you can assign messages to groups. When messages are assigned to groups Amazon Lex returns one message from each group in the response. The message field is an escaped JSON string containing the messages.
