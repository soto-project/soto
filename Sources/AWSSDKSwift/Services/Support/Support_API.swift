/**
AWS Support The AWS Support API reference is intended for programmers who need detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. This service enables you to manage your AWS Support cases programmatically. It uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format. The AWS Support service also exposes a set of Trusted Advisor features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks.  The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations:    Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels. The DescribeServices and DescribeSeverityLevels operations return AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the CreateCase operation.     Case creation, case details, and case resolution. The CreateCase, DescribeCases, DescribeAttachment, and ResolveCase operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases.    Case communication. The DescribeCommunications, AddCommunicationToCase, and AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases.    The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Support service for Trusted Advisor:    DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the list of checks that run against your AWS resources.   Using the checkId for a specific check returned by DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks, you can call DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult to obtain the results for the check you specified.    DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks.    RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check.     DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh status of one or more checks.    For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses Signature Version 4 Signing Process. See About the AWS Support API in the AWS Support User Guide for information about how to use this service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources.

If you do not indicate a value, the default is "technical."     serviceCode. The code for an AWS service. You obtain the serviceCode by calling DescribeServices.     categoryCode. The category for the service defined for the serviceCode value. You also obtain the category code for a service by calling DescribeServices. Each AWS service defines its own set of category codes.     severityCode. A value that indicates the urgency of the case, which in turn determines the response time according to your service level agreement with AWS Support. You obtain the SeverityCode by calling DescribeSeverityLevels.    subject. The Subject field on the AWS Support Center Create Case page.    communicationBody. The Description field on the AWS Support Center Create Case page.    attachmentSetId. The ID of a set of attachments that has been created by using AddAttachmentsToSet.    language. The human language in which AWS Support handles the case. English and Japanese are currently supported.    ccEmailAddresses. The AWS Support Center CC field on the Create Case page. You can list email addresses to be copied on any correspondence about the case. The account that opens the case is already identified by passing the AWS Credentials in the HTTP POST method or in a method or function call from one of the programming languages supported by an AWS SDK.     To add additional communication or attachments to an existing case, use AddCommunicationToCase.  A successful CreateCase request returns an AWS Support case number. Case numbers are used by the DescribeCases operation to retrieve existing AWS Support cases.
