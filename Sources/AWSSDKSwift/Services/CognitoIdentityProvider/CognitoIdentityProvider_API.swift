Client object for interacting with AWS CognitoIdentityProvider service.

Using the Amazon Cognito User Pools API, you can create a user pool to manage directories and users. You can authenticate a user to obtain tokens related to user identity and access policies. This API reference provides information about user pools in Amazon Cognito User Pools. For more information, see the Amazon Cognito Documentation.

If the user to disable is a linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an existing user is removed. The next time the external user (no longer attached to the previously linked DestinationUser) signs in, they must create a new user account. See . This action is enabled only for admin access and requires developer credentials. The ProviderName must match the value specified when creating an IdP for the pool.  To disable a native username + password user, the ProviderName value must be Cognito and the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject, with the ProviderAttributeValue being the name that is used in the user pool for the user. The ProviderAttributeName must always be Cognito_Subject for social identity providers. The ProviderAttributeValue must always be the exact subject that was used when the user was originally linked as a source user. For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked identity has not yet been used to sign-in, the ProviderAttributeName and ProviderAttributeValue must be the same values that were used for the SourceUser when the identities were originally linked in the call. (If the linking was done with ProviderAttributeName set to Cognito_Subject, the same applies here). However, if the user has already signed in, the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject and ProviderAttributeValue must be the subject of the SAML assertion.

For example, if there is an existing user with a username and password, this API links that user to a federated user identity, so that when the federated user identity is used, the user signs in as the existing user account.   Because this API allows a user with an external federated identity to sign in as an existing user in the user pool, it is critical that it only be used with external identity providers and provider attributes that have been trusted by the application owner.

A custom domain is used to host the Amazon Cognito hosted UI, which provides sign-up and sign-in pages for your application. When you set up a custom domain, you provide a certificate that you manage with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM). When necessary, you can use this operation to change the certificate that you applied to your custom domain. Usually, this is unnecessary following routine certificate renewal with ACM. When you renew your existing certificate in ACM, the ARN for your certificate remains the same, and your custom domain uses the new certificate automatically. However, if you replace your existing certificate with a new one, ACM gives the new certificate a new ARN. To apply the new certificate to your custom domain, you must provide this ARN to Amazon Cognito. When you add your new certificate in ACM, you must choose US East (N. Virginia) as the AWS Region. After you submit your request, Amazon Cognito requires up to 1 hour to distribute your new certificate to your custom domain. For more information about adding a custom domain to your user pool, see Using Your Own Domain for the Hosted UI.
