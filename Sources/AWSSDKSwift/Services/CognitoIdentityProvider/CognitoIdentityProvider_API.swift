If the user to disable is a linked external IdP user, any link between that user and an existing user is removed. The next time the external user (no longer attached to the previously linked DestinationUser) signs in, they must create a new user account. See . This action is enabled only for admin access and requires developer credentials. The ProviderName must match the value specified when creating an IdP for the pool.  To disable a native username + password user, the ProviderName value must be Cognito and the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject, with the ProviderAttributeValue being the name that is used in the user pool for the user. The ProviderAttributeName must always be Cognito_Subject for social identity providers. The ProviderAttributeValue must always be the exact subject that was used when the user was originally linked as a source user. For de-linking a SAML identity, there are two scenarios. If the linked identity has not yet been used to sign-in, the ProviderAttributeName and ProviderAttributeValue must be the same values that were used for the SourceUser when the identities were originally linked in the call. (If the linking was done with ProviderAttributeName set to Cognito_Subject, the same applies here). However, if the user has already signed in, the ProviderAttributeName must be Cognito_Subject and ProviderAttributeValue must be the subject of the SAML assertion.
