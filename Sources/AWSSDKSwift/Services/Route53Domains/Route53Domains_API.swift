    ///  This operation registers a domain. Domains are registered either by Amazon Registrar (for .com, .net, and .org domains) or by our registrar associate, Gandi (for all other domains). For some top-level domains (TLDs), this operation requires extra parameters. When you register a domain, Amazon Route 53 does the following:   Creates a Amazon Route 53 hosted zone that has the same name as the domain. Amazon Route 53 assigns four name servers to your hosted zone and automatically updates your domain registration with the names of these name servers.   Enables autorenew, so your domain registration will renew automatically each year. We'll notify you in advance of the renewal date so you can choose whether to renew the registration.   Optionally enables privacy protection, so WHOIS queries return contact information either for Amazon Registrar (for .com, .net, and .org domains) or for our registrar associate, Gandi (for all other TLDs). If you don't enable privacy protection, WHOIS queries return the information that you entered for the registrant, admin, and tech contacts.   If registration is successful, returns an operation ID that you can use to track the progress and completion of the action. If the request is not completed successfully, the domain registrant is notified by email.   Charges your AWS account an amount based on the top-level domain. For more information, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing.

For transfer requirements, a detailed procedure, and information about viewing the status of a domain transfer, see Transferring Registration for a Domain to Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for the domain, we highly recommend that you consider transferring your DNS service to Amazon Route 53 or to another DNS service provider before you transfer your registration. Some registrars provide free DNS service when you purchase a domain registration. When you transfer the registration, the previous registrar will not renew your domain registration and could end your DNS service at any time.  If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for the domain and you don't transfer DNS service to another provider, your website, email, and the web applications associated with the domain might become unavailable.
