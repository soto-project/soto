For AWS services, you can also specify the ARN or owning account of the associated resource as the SourceArn or SourceAccount.

The execution role grants the function permission to use AWS services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and AWS X-Ray for request tracing. A function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases. The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration. A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed to map to a different version. Use the Publish parameter to create version 1 of your function from its initial configuration. The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings. You can modify version-specific settings later with UpdateFunctionConfiguration. Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the function, and include tags (TagResource) and per-function concurrency limits (PutFunctionConcurrency). If another account or an AWS service invokes your function, use AddPermission to grant permission by creating a resource-based IAM policy. You can grant permissions at the function level, on a version, or on an alias. To invoke your function directly, use Invoke. To invoke your function in response to events in other AWS services, create an event source mapping (CreateEventSourceMapping), or configure a function trigger in the other service.

For synchronous invocation, details about the function response, including errors, are included in the response body and headers. For either invocation type, you can find more information in the execution log and trace. To record function errors for asynchronous invocations, configure your function with a dead letter queue. When an error occurs, your function may be invoked multiple times. Retry behavior varies by error type, client, event source, and invocation type. For example, if you invoke a function asynchronously and it returns an error, Lambda executes the function up to two more times. For more information, see Retry Behavior. The status code in the API response doesn't reflect function errors. Error codes are reserved for errors that prevent your function from executing, such as permissions errors, limit errors, or issues with your function's code and configuration. For example, Lambda returns TooManyRequestsException if executing the function would cause you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level (ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded) or function level (ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded). For functions with a long timeout, your client might be disconnected during synchronous invocation while it waits for a response. Configure your HTTP client, SDK, firewall, proxy, or operating system to allow for long connections with timeout or keep-alive settings.
