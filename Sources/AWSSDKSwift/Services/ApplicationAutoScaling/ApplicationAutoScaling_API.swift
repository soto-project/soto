/**
With Application Auto Scaling, you can configure automatic scaling for the following resources:   Amazon ECS services   Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet requests   Amazon EMR clusters   Amazon AppStream 2.0 fleets    Amazon DynamoDB tables and global secondary indexes throughput capacity   Amazon Aurora Replicas   Amazon SageMaker endpoint variants   Custom resources provided by your own applications or services    API Summary  The Application Auto Scaling service API includes three key sets of actions:    Register and manage scalable targets - Register AWS or custom resources as scalable targets (a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale), set minimum and maximum capacity limits, and retrieve information on existing scalable targets.   Configure and manage automatic scaling - Define scaling policies to dynamically scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms, schedule one-time or recurring scaling actions, and retrieve your recent scaling activity history.   Suspend and resume scaling - Temporarily suspend and later resume automatic scaling by calling the RegisterScalableTarget action for any Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can suspend and resume, individually or in combination, scale-out activities triggered by a scaling policy, scale-in activities triggered by a scaling policy, and scheduled scaling.    To learn more about Application Auto Scaling, including information about granting IAM users required permissions for Application Auto Scaling actions, see the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.

    ///  Creates or updates a policy for an Application Auto Scaling scalable target. Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID, and scalable dimension. A scaling policy applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scaling policy until you have registered the resource as a scalable target using RegisterScalableTarget. To update a policy, specify its policy name and the parameters that you want to change. Any parameters that you don't specify are not changed by this update request. You can view the scaling policies for a service namespace using DescribeScalingPolicies. If you are no longer using a scaling policy, you can delete it using DeleteScalingPolicy. Multiple scaling policies can be in force at the same time for the same scalable target. You can have one or more target tracking scaling policies, one or more step scaling policies, or both. However, there is a chance that multiple policies could conflict, instructing the scalable target to scale out or in at the same time. Application Auto Scaling gives precedence to the policy that provides the largest capacity for both scale in and scale out. For example, if one policy increases capacity by 3, another policy increases capacity by 200 percent, and the current capacity is 10, Application Auto Scaling uses the policy with the highest calculated capacity (200% of 10 = 20) and scales out to 30.

When you register a new scalable target, you must specify values for minimum and maximum capacity. Application Auto Scaling will not scale capacity to values that are outside of this range.  To update a scalable target, specify the parameter that you want to change as well as the following parameters that identify the scalable target: resource ID, scalable dimension, and namespace. Any parameters that you don't specify are not changed by this update request.
