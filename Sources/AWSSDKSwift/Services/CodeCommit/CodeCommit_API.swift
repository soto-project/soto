/**
Client object for interacting with AWS CodeCommit service.

AWS CodeCommit This is the AWS CodeCommit API Reference. This reference provides descriptions of the operations and data types for AWS CodeCommit API along with usage examples. You can use the AWS CodeCommit API to work with the following objects: Repositories, by calling the following:    BatchGetRepositories, which returns information about one or more repositories associated with your AWS account.    CreateRepository, which creates an AWS CodeCommit repository.    DeleteRepository, which deletes an AWS CodeCommit repository.    GetRepository, which returns information about a specified repository.    ListRepositories, which lists all AWS CodeCommit repositories associated with your AWS account.    UpdateRepositoryDescription, which sets or updates the description of the repository.    UpdateRepositoryName, which changes the name of the repository. If you change the name of a repository, no other users of that repository can access it until you send them the new HTTPS or SSH URL to use.   Branches, by calling the following:    CreateBranch, which creates a branch in a specified repository.    DeleteBranch, which deletes the specified branch in a repository unless it is the default branch.    GetBranch, which returns information about a specified branch.

GetFolder, which returns the contents of a specified folder or directory.    PutFile, which adds or modifies a single file in a specified repository and branch.   Commits, by calling the following:    BatchGetCommits, which returns information about one or more commits in a repository.    CreateCommit, which creates a commit for changes to a repository.    GetCommit, which returns information about a commit, including commit messages and author and committer information.    GetDifferences, which returns information about the differences in a valid commit specifier (such as a branch, tag, HEAD, commit ID, or other fully qualified reference).   Merges, by calling the following:    BatchDescribeMergeConflicts, which returns information about conflicts in a merge between commits in a repository.    CreateUnreferencedMergeCommit, which creates an unreferenced commit between two branches or commits for the purpose of comparing them and identifying any potential conflicts.    DescribeMergeConflicts, which returns information about merge conflicts between the base, source, and destination versions of a file in a potential merge.    GetMergeCommit, which returns information about the merge between a source and destination commit.     GetMergeConflicts, which returns information about merge conflicts between the source and destination branch in a pull request.    GetMergeOptions, which returns information about the available merge options between two branches or commit specifiers.    MergeBranchesByFastForward, which merges two branches using the fast-forward merge option.    MergeBranchesBySquash, which merges two branches using the squash merge option.    MergeBranchesByThreeWay, which merges two branches using the three-way merge option.   Pull requests, by calling the following:    CreatePullRequest, which creates a pull request in a specified repository.    CreatePullRequestApprovalRule, which creates an approval rule for a specified pull request.    DeletePullRequestApprovalRule, which deletes an approval rule for a specified pull request.    DescribePullRequestEvents, which returns information about one or more pull request events.

GetCommentsForPullRequest, which returns information about comments on a specified pull request.    GetPullRequest, which returns information about a specified pull request.    GetPullRequestApprovalStates, which returns information about the approval states for a specified pull request.    GetPullRequestOverrideState, which returns information about whether approval rules have been set aside (overriden) for a pull request, and if so, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user or identity that overrode the rules and their requirements for the pull request.    ListPullRequests, which lists all pull requests for a repository.    MergePullRequestByFastForward, which merges the source destination branch of a pull request into the specified destination branch for that pull request using the fast-forward merge option.    MergePullRequestBySquash, which merges the source destination branch of a pull request into the specified destination branch for that pull request using the squash merge option.    MergePullRequestByThreeWay. which merges the source destination branch of a pull request into the specified destination branch for that pull request using the three-way merge option.    OverridePullRequestApprovalRules, which sets aside all approval rule requirements for a pull request.    PostCommentForPullRequest, which posts a comment to a pull request at the specified line, file, or request.

Approval rule templates, by calling the following:    AssociateApprovalRuleTemplateWithRepository, which associates a template with a specified repository. After the template is associated with a repository, AWS CodeCommit creates approval rules that match the template conditions on every pull request created in the specified repository.

After the template is associated with a repository, AWS CodeCommit creates approval rules that match the template conditions on every pull request created in the specified repositories.
