/**
Client object for interacting with AWS Snowball service.

AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snowball commands described here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snowball Management Console, which enables you to create and manage jobs for Snowball. To transfer data locally with a Snowball device, you'll need to use the Snowball client or the Amazon S3 API adapter for Snowball. For more information, see the User Guide.

As a best practice, we recommend that you don't save a copy of an UnlockCode value in the same location as the manifest file for that job.
