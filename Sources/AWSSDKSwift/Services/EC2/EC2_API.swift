After creating the set, you must associate it with the VPC, causing all existing and new instances that you launch in the VPC to use this set of DHCP options. The following are the individual DHCP options you can specify. For more information about the options, see RFC 2132.    domain-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four domain name servers, or AmazonProvidedDNS. The default DHCP option set specifies AmazonProvidedDNS. If specifying more than one domain name server, specify the IP addresses in a single parameter, separated by commas. To have your instance receive a custom DNS hostname as specified in domain-name, you must set domain-name-servers to a custom DNS server.    domain-name - If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in us-east-1, specify ec2.internal. If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in another Region, specify region.compute.internal (for example, ap-northeast-1.compute.internal). Otherwise, specify a domain name (for example, MyCompany.com). This value is used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames. Important: Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces. However, Windows and other Linux operating systems treat the value as a single domain, which results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP options set is associated with a VPC that has instances with multiple operating systems, specify only one domain name.    ntp-servers - The IP addresses of up to four Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.    netbios-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name servers.    netbios-node-type - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that you specify 2 (broadcast and multicast are not currently supported). For more information about these node types, see RFC 2132.   Your VPC automatically starts out with a set of DHCP options that includes only a DNS server that we provide (AmazonProvidedDNS). If you create a set of options, and if your VPC has an internet gateway, make sure to set the domain-name-servers option either to AmazonProvidedDNS or to a domain name server of your choice.

The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event. The DescribeVolumeStatus operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:  Status: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are ok, impaired , warning, or insufficient-data. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is ok. If the check fails, the overall status is impaired. If the status is insufficient-data, then the checks may still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more information about volume status, see Monitoring the Status of Your Volumes in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.  Events: Reflect the cause of a volume status and may require you to take action. For example, if your volume returns an impaired status, then the volume event might be potential-data-inconsistency. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and may have inconsistent data.  Actions: Reflect the actions you may have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is impaired and the volume event shows potential-data-inconsistency, then the action shows enable-volume-io. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the EnableVolumeIO action and then check the volume for data consistency. Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the error state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)

Use CreateVpnGateway to create a virtual private gateway, or CreateTransitGateway to create a transit gateway. This step is required when you migrate from a virtual private gateway with static routes to a transit gateway.  You must delete the static routes before you migrate to the new gateway. Keep a copy of the static route before you delete it. You will need to add back these routes to the transit gateway after the VPN connection migration is complete. After you migrate to the new gateway, you might need to modify your VPC route table. Use CreateRoute and DeleteRoute to make the changes described in VPN Gateway Target Modification Required VPC Route Table Updates in the AWS Site-to-Site VPN User Guide.  When the new gateway is a transit gateway, modify the transit gateway route table to allow traffic between the VPC and the AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. Use CreateTransitGatewayRoute to add the routes.  If you deleted VPN static routes, you must add the static routes to the transit gateway route table. After you perform this operation, the AWS VPN endpoint's IP addresses on the AWS side and the tunnel options remain intact.

For more information, see Launching a Linux Instance from a Backup in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. You can't register an image where a secondary (non-root) snapshot has AWS Marketplace product codes. Some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), use the EC2 billing product code associated with an AMI to verify the subscription status for package updates. Creating an AMI from an EBS snapshot does not maintain this billing code, and instances launched from such an AMI are not able to connect to package update infrastructure. If you purchase a Reserved Instance offering for one of these Linux distributions and launch instances using an AMI that does not contain the required billing code, your Reserved Instance is not applied to these instances. To create an AMI for operating systems that require a billing code, see CreateImage. If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time.

    ///  Shuts down the specified instances. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds.  If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated. Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one hour). By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running. You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached EBS volumes with the DeleteOnTermination block device mapping parameter set to true are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between stopping and terminating instances, see Instance Lifecycle in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. For more information about troubleshooting, see Troubleshooting Terminating Your Instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
