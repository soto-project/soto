    ///  Starts an Amazon EBS-backed instance that you've previously stopped. Instances that use Amazon EBS volumes as their root devices can be quickly stopped and started. When an instance is stopped, the compute resources are released and you are not billed for instance usage. However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time. Every time you start your Windows instance, Amazon EC2 charges you for a full instance hour. If you stop and restart your Windows instance, a new instance hour begins and Amazon EC2 charges you for another full instance hour even if you are still within the same 60-minute period when it was stopped. Every time you start your Linux instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage. Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM. Performing this operation on an instance that uses an instance store as its root device returns an error. For more information, see Stopping Instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

    ///  Stops an Amazon EBS-backed instance. You can use the Stop action to hibernate an instance if the instance is enabled for hibernation and it meets the hibernation prerequisites. For more information, see Hibernate Your Instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. We don't charge usage for a stopped instance, or data transfer fees; however, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. Every time you start your Windows instance, Amazon EC2 charges you for a full instance hour. If you stop and restart your Windows instance, a new instance hour begins and Amazon EC2 charges you for another full instance hour even if you are still within the same 60-minute period when it was stopped. Every time you start your Linux instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage. You can't start, stop, or hibernate Spot Instances, and you can't stop or hibernate instance store-backed instances. For information about using hibernation for Spot Instances, see Hibernating Interrupted Spot Instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. When you stop or hibernate an instance, we shut it down. You can restart your instance at any time. Before stopping or hibernating an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM, but hibernating an instance does preserve data stored in RAM. If an instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown occurs. Stopping and hibernating an instance is different to rebooting or terminating it. For example, when you stop or hibernate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, the root device and any other devices attached during the instance launch are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between rebooting, stopping, hibernating, and terminating instances, see Instance Lifecycle in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. When you stop an instance, we attempt to shut it down forcibly after a short while. If your instance appears stuck in the stopping state after a period of time, there may be an issue with the underlying host computer. For more information, see Troubleshooting Stopping Your Instance in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.

    ///  Shuts down one or more instances. This operation is idempotent; if you terminate an instance more than once, each call succeeds.  If you specify multiple instances and the request fails (for example, because of a single incorrect instance ID), none of the instances are terminated. Terminated instances remain visible after termination (for approximately one hour). By default, Amazon EC2 deletes all EBS volumes that were attached when the instance launched. Volumes attached after instance launch continue running. You can stop, start, and terminate EBS-backed instances. You can only terminate instance store-backed instances. What happens to an instance differs if you stop it or terminate it. For example, when you stop an instance, the root device and any other devices attached to the instance persist. When you terminate an instance, any attached EBS volumes with the DeleteOnTermination block device mapping parameter set to true are automatically deleted. For more information about the differences between stopping and terminating instances, see Instance Lifecycle in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.
