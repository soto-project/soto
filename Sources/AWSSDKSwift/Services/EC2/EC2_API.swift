For more information about the options, see RFC 2132.    domain-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four domain name servers, or AmazonProvidedDNS. The default DHCP option set specifies AmazonProvidedDNS. If specifying more than one domain name server, specify the IP addresses in a single parameter, separated by commas. To have your instance receive a custom DNS hostname as specified in domain-name, you must set domain-name-servers to a custom DNS server.    domain-name - If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in us-east-1, specify ec2.internal. If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in another Region, specify region.compute.internal (for example, ap-northeast-1.compute.internal). Otherwise, specify a domain name (for example, MyCompany.com). This value is used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames. Important: Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces. However, Windows and other Linux operating systems treat the value as a single domain, which results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP options set is associated with a VPC that has instances with multiple operating systems, specify only one domain name.    ntp-servers - The IP addresses of up to four Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers.    netbios-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name servers.    netbios-node-type - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that you specify 2 (broadcast and multicast are not currently supported). For more information about these node types, see RFC 2132.   Your VPC automatically starts out with a set of DHCP options that includes only a DNS server that we provide (AmazonProvidedDNS). If you create a set of options, and if your VPC has an internet gateway, make sure to set the domain-name-servers option either to AmazonProvidedDNS or to a domain name server of your choice.

The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event. The DescribeVolumeStatus operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:  Status: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are ok, impaired , warning, or insufficient-data. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is ok. If the check fails, the overall status is impaired. If the status is insufficient-data, then the checks may still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more information about volume status, see Monitoring the Status of Your Volumes in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.  Events: Reflect the cause of a volume status and may require you to take action. For example, if your volume returns an impaired status, then the volume event might be potential-data-inconsistency. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and may have inconsistent data.  Actions: Reflect the actions you may have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is impaired and the volume event shows potential-data-inconsistency, then the action shows enable-volume-io. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the EnableVolumeIO action and then check the volume for data consistency.

Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the error state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)

You can restart your instance at any time. Before stopping or hibernating an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted. Stopping an instance does not preserve data stored in RAM, but hibernating an instance does preserve data stored in RAM. If an instance cannot hibernate successfully, a normal shutdown occurs.
