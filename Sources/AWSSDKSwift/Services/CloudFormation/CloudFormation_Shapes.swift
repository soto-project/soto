You can specify only resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED state because a rollback failed. You can't specify resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED state for other reasons, for example, because an update was cancelled. To check why a resource update failed, use the DescribeStackResources action, and view the resource status reason.   Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that AWS CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you  troubleshoot resources before skipping them. AWS CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to UPDATE_COMPLETE and continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack template. Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.   Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources.  To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following format: NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID. If you want to specify the logical ID of a stack resource (Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack) in the ResourcesToSkip list, then its corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states: DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, DELETE_COMPLETE, or DELETE_FAILED.   Don't confuse a child stack's name with its corresponding logical ID defined in the parent stack. For an example of a continue update rollback operation with nested stacks, see Using ResourcesToSkip to recover a nested stacks hierarchy.

        /// In some cases, you must explicity acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for AWS CloudFormation to create the stack.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.    If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.    If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group      AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User      AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS CloudFormation Templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. Change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.

Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that AWS CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create a stack with the same name. You might retry CreateStack requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them. All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.

You might retry DeleteStack requests to ensure that AWS CloudFormation successfully received them.

For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.

DirectModification entities are changes that are made directly to the template.    Automatic entities are AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource types, which are also known as nested stacks. If you made no changes to the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource, AWS CloudFormation sets the ChangeSource to Automatic because the nested stack's template might have changed.

For Dynamic evaluations, cannot determine the target value because it depends on the result of an intrinsic function, such as a Ref or Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, when the stack is updated. For example, if your template includes a reference to a resource that is conditionally recreated, the value of the reference (the physical ID of the resource) might change, depending on if the resource is recreated. If the resource is recreated, it will have a new physical ID, so all references to that resource will also be updated.

CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.    If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.    If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. Change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.

All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.

When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how AWS CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance update operations:   To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter and specify its value.   To leave a parameter set to its present value, you can do one of the following:   Do not include the parameter in the list.   Include the parameter and specify UsePreviousValue as true. (You cannot specify both a value and set UsePreviousValue to true.)     To set all overridden parameter back to the values specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but do not include any parameters.   To leave all parameters set to their present values, do not specify this property at all.   During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only override the parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter value specified in the stack set you must first use UpdateStackSet to update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter value specified in the stack set. Once a stack instance has been updated with the new parameter, you can then override the parameter value using UpdateStackInstances.

If you specify new tags as part of an UpdateStackSet action, AWS CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission to tag resources. If you omit tags that are currently associated with the stack set from the list of tags you specify, AWS CloudFormation assumes that you want to remove those tags from the stack set, and checks to see if you have permission to untag resources.
