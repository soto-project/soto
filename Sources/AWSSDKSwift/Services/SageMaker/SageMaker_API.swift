Tags that you add to a hyperparameter tuning job by calling this API are also added to any training jobs that the hyperparameter tuning job launches after you call this API, but not to training jobs that the hyperparameter tuning job launched before you called this API.

When a domain is created, an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) volume is also created for use by all of the users within the domain. Each user receives a private home directory within the EFS for notebooks, Git repositories, and data files. All traffic between the domain and the EFS volume is communicated through the specified subnet IDs. All other traffic goes over the Internet through an Amazon SageMaker system VPC. The EFS traffic uses the NFS/TCP protocol over port 2049.  NFS traffic over TCP on port 2049 needs to be allowed in both inbound and outbound rules in order to launch a SageMaker Studio app successfully.

    ///  Creates an endpoint using the endpoint configuration specified in the request. Amazon SageMaker uses the endpoint to provision resources and deploy models. You create the endpoint configuration with the CreateEndpointConfig API.   Use this API to deploy models using Amazon SageMaker hosting services.  For an example that calls this method when deploying a model to Amazon SageMaker hosting services, see Deploy the Model to Amazon SageMaker Hosting Services (AWS SDK for Python (Boto 3)).    You must not delete an EndpointConfig that is in use by an endpoint that is live or while the UpdateEndpoint or CreateEndpoint operations are being performed on the endpoint. To update an endpoint, you must create a new EndpointConfig.  The endpoint name must be unique within an AWS Region in your AWS account.  When it receives the request, Amazon SageMaker creates the endpoint, launches the resources (ML compute instances), and deploys the model(s) on them.   When you call CreateEndpoint, a load call is made to DynamoDB to verify that your endpoint configuration exists. When you read data from a DynamoDB table supporting  Eventually Consistent Reads , the response might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The response might include some stale data. If the dependent entities are not yet in DynamoDB, this causes a validation error. If you repeat your read request after a short time, the response should return the latest data. So retry logic is recommended to handle these possible issues. We also recommend that customers call DescribeEndpointConfig before calling CreateEndpoint to minimize the potential impact of a DynamoDB eventually consistent read.  When Amazon SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to Creating. After it creates the endpoint, it sets the status to InService. Amazon SageMaker can then process incoming requests for inferences. To check the status of an endpoint, use the DescribeEndpoint API. If any of the models hosted at this endpoint get model data from an Amazon S3 location, Amazon SageMaker uses AWS Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provided. AWS STS is activated in your IAM user account by default. If you previously deactivated AWS STS for a region, you need to reactivate AWS STS for that region. For more information, see Activating and Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.

Then you call the CreateEndpoint API.   Use this API if you want to use Amazon SageMaker hosting services to deploy models into production.   In the request, you define a ProductionVariant, for each model that you want to deploy. Each ProductionVariant parameter also describes the resources that you want Amazon SageMaker to provision. This includes the number and type of ML compute instances to deploy.  If you are hosting multiple models, you also assign a VariantWeight to specify how much traffic you want to allocate to each model. For example, suppose that you want to host two models, A and B, and you assign traffic weight 2 for model A and 1 for model B. Amazon SageMaker distributes two-thirds of the traffic to Model A, and one-third to model B.  For an example that calls this method when deploying a model to Amazon SageMaker hosting services, see Deploy the Model to Amazon SageMaker Hosting Services (AWS SDK for Python (Boto 3)).

You can also use automated data labeling to reduce the number of data objects that need to be labeled by a human. Automated data labeling uses active learning to determine if a data object can be labeled by machine or if it needs to be sent to a human worker. For more information, see Using Automated Data Labeling. The data objects to be labeled are contained in an Amazon S3 bucket. You create a manifest file that describes the location of each object. For more information, see Using Input and Output Data. The output can be used as the manifest file for another labeling job or as training data for your machine learning models.

Use this API to create a model if you want to use Amazon SageMaker hosting services or run a batch transform job. To host your model, you create an endpoint configuration with the CreateEndpointConfig API, and then create an endpoint with the CreateEndpoint API. Amazon SageMaker then deploys all of the containers that you defined for the model in the hosting environment.  For an example that calls this method when deploying a model to Amazon SageMaker hosting services, see Deploy the Model to Amazon SageMaker Hosting Services (AWS SDK for Python (Boto 3)).  To run a batch transform using your model, you start a job with the CreateTransformJob API. Amazon SageMaker uses your model and your dataset to get inferences which are then saved to a specified S3 location. In the CreateModel request, you must define a container with the PrimaryContainer parameter. In the request, you also provide an IAM role that Amazon SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and docker image for deployment on ML compute hosting instances or for batch transform jobs. In addition, you also use the IAM role to manage permissions the inference code needs. For example, if the inference code access any other AWS resources, you grant necessary permissions via this role.

In a CreateNotebookInstance request, specify the type of ML compute instance that you want to run. Amazon SageMaker launches the instance, installs common libraries that you can use to explore datasets for model training, and attaches an ML storage volume to the notebook instance.  Amazon SageMaker also provides a set of example notebooks. Each notebook demonstrates how to use Amazon SageMaker with a specific algorithm or with a machine learning framework.  After receiving the request, Amazon SageMaker does the following:   Creates a network interface in the Amazon SageMaker VPC.   (Option) If you specified SubnetId, Amazon SageMaker creates a network interface in your own VPC, which is inferred from the subnet ID that you provide in the input. When creating this network interface, Amazon SageMaker attaches the security group that you specified in the request to the network interface that it creates in your VPC.   Launches an EC2 instance of the type specified in the request in the Amazon SageMaker VPC. If you specified SubnetId of your VPC, Amazon SageMaker specifies both network interfaces when launching this instance. This enables inbound traffic from your own VPC to the notebook instance, assuming that the security groups allow it.   After creating the notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can't change the name of a notebook instance after you create it. After Amazon SageMaker creates the notebook instance, you can connect to the Jupyter server and work in Jupyter notebooks. For example, you can write code to explore a dataset that you can use for model training, train a model, host models by creating Amazon SageMaker endpoints, and validate hosted models.
