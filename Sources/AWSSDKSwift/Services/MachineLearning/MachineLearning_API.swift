This operation creates a new BatchPrediction, and uses an MLModel and the data files referenced by the DataSource as information sources.  CreateBatchPrediction is an asynchronous operation. In response to CreateBatchPrediction, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns and sets the BatchPrediction status to PENDING. After the BatchPrediction completes, Amazon ML sets the status to COMPLETED.  You can poll for status updates by using the GetBatchPrediction operation and checking the Status parameter of the result.

A DataSource references data that can be used to perform CreateMLModel, CreateEvaluation, or CreateBatchPrediction operations. CreateDataSourceFromRDS is an asynchronous operation. In response to CreateDataSourceFromRDS, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns and sets the DataSource status to PENDING. After the DataSource is created and ready for use, Amazon ML sets the Status parameter to COMPLETED. DataSource in the COMPLETED or PENDING state can be used only to perform &gt;CreateMLModel&gt;, CreateEvaluation, or CreateBatchPrediction operations.   If Amazon ML cannot accept the input source, it sets the Status parameter to FAILED and includes an error message in the Message attribute of the GetDataSource operation response.

    ///  Creates a DataSource from a database hosted on an Amazon Redshift cluster. A DataSource references data that can be used to perform either CreateMLModel, CreateEvaluation, or CreateBatchPrediction operations. CreateDataSourceFromRedshift is an asynchronous operation. In response to CreateDataSourceFromRedshift, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns and sets the DataSource status to PENDING. After the DataSource is created and ready for use, Amazon ML sets the Status parameter to COMPLETED. DataSource in COMPLETED or PENDING states can be used to perform only CreateMLModel, CreateEvaluation, or CreateBatchPrediction operations.   If Amazon ML can't accept the input source, it sets the Status parameter to FAILED and includes an error message in the Message attribute of the GetDataSource operation response.  The observations should be contained in the database hosted on an Amazon Redshift cluster and should be specified by a SelectSqlQuery query. Amazon ML executes an Unload command in Amazon Redshift to transfer the result set of the SelectSqlQuery query to S3StagingLocation. After the DataSource has been created, it's ready for use in evaluations and batch predictions. If you plan to use the DataSource to train an MLModel, the DataSource also requires a recipe. A recipe describes how each input variable will be used in training an MLModel. Will the variable be included or excluded from training? Will the variable be manipulated; for example, will it be combined with another variable or will it be split apart into word combinations? The recipe provides answers to these questions. You can't change an existing datasource, but you can copy and modify the settings from an existing Amazon Redshift datasource to create a new datasource. To do so, call GetDataSource for an existing datasource and copy the values to a CreateDataSource call. Change the settings that you want to change and make sure that all required fields have the appropriate values.

CreateDataSourceFromS3 is an asynchronous operation. In response to CreateDataSourceFromS3, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns and sets the DataSource status to PENDING. After the DataSource has been created and is ready for use, Amazon ML sets the Status parameter to COMPLETED. DataSource in the COMPLETED or PENDING state can be used to perform only CreateMLModel, CreateEvaluation or CreateBatchPrediction operations.   If Amazon ML can't accept the input source, it sets the Status parameter to FAILED and includes an error message in the Message attribute of the GetDataSource operation response.  The observation data used in a DataSource should be ready to use; that is, it should have a consistent structure, and missing data values should be kept to a minimum. The observation data must reside in one or more .csv files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) location, along with a schema that describes the data items by name and type. The same schema must be used for all of the data files referenced by the DataSource.  After the DataSource has been created, it's ready to use in evaluations and batch predictions. If you plan to use the DataSource to train an MLModel, the DataSource also needs a recipe. A recipe describes how each input variable will be used in training an MLModel.

Evaluation generates a relevant performance metric, such as BinaryAUC, RegressionRMSE or MulticlassAvgFScore based on the corresponding MLModelType: BINARY, REGRESSION or MULTICLASS.  CreateEvaluation is an asynchronous operation. In response to CreateEvaluation, Amazon Machine Learning (Amazon ML) immediately returns and sets the evaluation status to PENDING. After the Evaluation is created and ready for use, Amazon ML sets the status to COMPLETED.  You can use the GetEvaluation operation to check progress of the evaluation during the creation operation.

After the MLModel has been created and ready is for use, Amazon ML sets the status to COMPLETED.  You can use the GetMLModel operation to check the progress of the MLModel during the creation operation.
