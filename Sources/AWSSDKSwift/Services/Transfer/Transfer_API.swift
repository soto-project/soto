/**
Client object for interacting with AWS Transfer service.

AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). AWS helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to AWS Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with AWS services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with AWS Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.
