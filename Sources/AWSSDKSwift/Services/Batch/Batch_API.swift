/**
AWS Batch enables you to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. Batch computing is a common way for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources, and AWS Batch removes the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing the required infrastructure. AWS Batch will be familiar to users of traditional batch computing software. This service can efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted in order to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver results quickly. As a fully managed service, AWS Batch enables developers, scientists, and engineers to run batch computing workloads of any scale. AWS Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes the workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of the workloads. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install or manage batch computing software, which allows you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems. AWS Batch reduces operational complexities, saves time, and reduces costs, which makes it easy for developers, scientists, and engineers to run their batch jobs in the AWS Cloud.

    ///  Creates an AWS Batch compute environment. You can create MANAGED or UNMANAGED compute environments. In a managed compute environment, AWS Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the launch template that you specify when you create the compute environment. You can choose to use Amazon EC2 On-Demand Instances or Spot Instances in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is below a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.  Multi-node parallel jobs are not supported on Spot Instances.  In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own compute resources. This provides more compute resource configuration options, such as using a custom AMI, but you must ensure that your AMI meets the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see Container Instance AMIs in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. After you have created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the DescribeComputeEnvironments operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that is associated with it. Then, manually launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see Launching an Amazon ECS Container Instance in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.  AWS Batch does not upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after it is created (for example, when a newer version of the Amazon ECS-optimized AMI is available). You are responsible for the management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches) and any additional application software or utilities that you install on the compute resources. To use a new AMI for your AWS Batch jobs:   Create a new compute environment with the new AMI.   Add the compute environment to an existing job queue.   Remove the old compute environment from your job queue.   Delete the old compute environment.
