    ///  Creates an Amazon Forecast dataset. The information about the dataset that you provide helps Forecast understand how to consume the data for model training. This includes the following:     DataFrequency  - How frequently your historical time-series data is collected. Amazon Forecast uses this information when training the model and generating a forecast.     Domain  and  DatasetType  - Each dataset has an associated dataset domain and a type within the domain. Amazon Forecast provides a list of predefined domains and types within each domain. For each unique dataset domain and type within the domain, Amazon Forecast requires your data to include a minimum set of predefined fields.     Schema  - A schema specifies the fields of the dataset, including the field name and data type.   After creating a dataset, you import your training data into the dataset and add the dataset to a dataset group. You then use the dataset group to create a predictor. For more information, see howitworks-datasets-groups. To get a list of all your datasets, use the ListDatasets operation.  The Status of a dataset must be ACTIVE before you can import training data. Use the DescribeDataset operation to get the status.

    ///  Imports your training data to an Amazon Forecast dataset. You provide the location of your training data in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset that you want to import the data to. You must specify a DataSource object that includes an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the data. For more information, see aws-forecast-iam-roles. Two properties of the training data are optionally specified:   The delimiter that separates the data fields. The default delimiter is a comma (,), which is the only supported delimiter in this release.   The format of timestamps. If the format is not specified, Amazon Forecast expects the format to be "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss".   When Amazon Forecast uploads your training data, it verifies that the data was collected at the DataFrequency specified when the target dataset was created. For more information, see CreateDataset and howitworks-datasets-groups. Amazon Forecast also verifies the delimiter and timestamp format. You can use the ListDatasetImportJobs operation to get a list of all your dataset import jobs, filtered by specified criteria. To get a list of all your dataset import jobs, filtered by the specified criteria, use the ListDatasetGroups operation.

The range of the forecast is determined by the ForecastHorizon, specified in the CreatePredictor request, multiplied by the DataFrequency, specified in the CreateDataset request. When you query a forecast, you can request a specific date range within the complete forecast. To get a list of all your forecasts, use the ListForecasts operation.  The forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast are in the same timezone as the dataset that was used to create the predictor.  For more information, see howitworks-forecast.

If you specify an algorithm, you also can override algorithm-specific hyperparameters. Amazon Forecast uses the chosen algorithm to train a model using the latest version of the datasets in the specified dataset group. The result is called a predictor. You then generate a forecast using the CreateForecast operation. After training a model, the CreatePredictor operation also evaluates it. To see the evaluation metrics, use the GetAccuracyMetrics operation. Always review the evaluation metrics before deciding to use the predictor to generate a forecast. Optionally, you can specify a featurization configuration to fill and aggragate the data fields in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset to improve model training. For more information, see FeaturizationConfig.  AutoML  If you set PerformAutoML to true, Amazon Forecast evaluates each algorithm and chooses the one that minimizes the objective function. The objective function is defined as the mean of the weighted p10, p50, and p90 quantile losses. For more information, see EvaluationResult. When AutoML is enabled, the following properties are disallowed:    AlgorithmArn     HPOConfig     PerformHPO     TrainingParameters    To get a list of all your predictors, use the ListPredictors operation.
