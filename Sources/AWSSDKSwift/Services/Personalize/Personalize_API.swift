    ///  Creates a campaign by deploying a solution version. When a client calls the GetRecommendations and GetPersonalizedRanking APIs, a campaign is specified in the request.  Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling  A transaction is a single GetRecommendations or GetPersonalizedRanking call. Transactions per second (TPS) is the throughput and unit of billing for Amazon Personalize. The minimum provisioned TPS (minProvisionedTPS) specifies the baseline throughput provisioned by Amazon Personalize, and thus, the minimum billing charge. If your TPS increases beyond minProvisionedTPS, Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below minProvisionedTPS, to maintain a 70% utilization. There's a short time delay while the capacity is increased that might cause loss of transactions. It's recommended to start with a low minProvisionedTPS, track your usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and then increase the minProvisionedTPS as necessary.  Status  A campaign can be in one of the following states:   CREATE PENDING &gt; CREATE IN_PROGRESS &gt; ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED   DELETE PENDING &gt; DELETE IN_PROGRESS   To get the campaign status, call DescribeCampaign.
