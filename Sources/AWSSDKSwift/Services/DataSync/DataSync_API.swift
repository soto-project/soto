Client object for interacting with AWS DataSync service.

AWS DataSync AWS DataSync is a managed data transfer service that makes it simpler for you to automate moving data between on-premises storage and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS).  This API interface reference for AWS DataSync contains documentation for a programming interface that you can use to manage AWS DataSync.

    ///  Cancels execution of a task.  When you cancel a task execution, the transfer of some files are abruptly interrupted. The contents of files that are transferred to the destination might be incomplete or inconsistent with the source files. However, if you start a new task execution on the same task and you allow the task execution to complete, file content on the destination is complete and consistent. This applies to other unexpected failures that interrupt a task execution. In all of these cases, AWS DataSync successfully complete the transfer when you start the next task execution.

    ///  Activates an AWS DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host. The activation process associates your agent with your account. In the activation process, you specify information such as the AWS Region that you want to activate the agent in. You activate the agent in the AWS Region where your target locations (in Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS) reside. Your tasks are created in this AWS Region. You can activate the agent in a VPC (Virtual private Cloud) or provide the agent access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks without going over the public Internet. You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If you use multiple agents for a source location, the status of all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task to run.  Agents are automatically updated by AWS on a regular basis, using a mechanism that ensures minimal interruption to your tasks.

An example of such a policy is shown in the examples section.

If you don't specify Options when you create a task, AWS DataSync populates them with service defaults. When you create a task, it first enters the CREATING state. During CREATING AWS DataSync attempts to mount the on-premises Network File System (NFS) location. The task transitions to the AVAILABLE state without waiting for the AWS location to become mounted. If required, AWS DataSync mounts the AWS location before each task execution. If an agent that is associated with a source (NFS) location goes offline, the task transitions to the UNAVAILABLE status. If the status of the task remains in the CREATING status for more than a few minutes, it means that your agent might be having trouble mounting the source NFS file system. Check the task's ErrorCode and ErrorDetail. Mount issues are often caused by either a misconfigured firewall or a mistyped NFS server host name.
