/**
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.  Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification required.

    ///  Creates an Amazon EKS control plane.  The Amazon EKS control plane consists of control plane instances that run the Kubernetes software, such as etcd and the API server. The control plane runs in an account managed by AWS, and the Kubernetes API is exposed via the Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single-tenant and unique and runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances. The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the worker nodes (for example, to support kubectl exec, logs, and proxy data flows). Amazon EKS worker nodes run in your AWS account and connect to your cluster's control plane via the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster. You can use the endpointPublicAccess and endpointPrivateAccess parameters to enable or disable public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. By default, public access is enabled, and private access is disabled. For more information, see Amazon EKS Cluster Endpoint Access Control in the  Amazon EKS User Guide .  You can use the logging parameter to enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster control plane logs aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see Amazon EKS Cluster Control Plane Logs in the  Amazon EKS User Guide .  CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning rates apply to exported control plane logs. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing.  Cluster creation typically takes between 10 and 15 minutes. After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API server and launch worker nodes into your cluster. For more information, see Managing Cluster Authentication and Launching Amazon EKS Worker Nodes in the Amazon EKS User Guide.
