The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.     https-only: If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).    For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see Using an HTTPS Connection to Access Your Objects in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.  The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects' cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously.

If you substitute 200, the response typically won't be intercepted.   If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify 400 or 500 as the ResponseCode for all 4xx or 5xx errors.   You might want to return a 200 status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down.

For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named /4xx-errors. Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, /4xx-errors/*.    The value of TargetOriginId specifies the value of the ID element for the origin that contains your custom error pages.   If you specify a value for ResponsePagePath, you must also specify a value for ResponseCode. If you don't want to specify a value, include an empty element, &lt;ResponsePagePath&gt;, in the XML document. We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket.

For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see Using an HTTPS Connection to Access Your Objects in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.  The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects' cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously.

However, if you're using signed URLs or signed cookies to restrict access to your content, and if you're using a custom policy that includes the IpAddress parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access to some content by IP address and not restrict access to other content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can create two distributions. For more information, see Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Amazon Route 53 or with another DNS service, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route traffic to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of the viewer request.

For more information about specifying this value for different types of origins, see Origin Domain Name in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

A security policy determines two settings:   The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront uses to communicate with viewers   The cipher that CloudFront uses to encrypt the content that it returns to viewers    On the CloudFront console, this setting is called Security policy.  We recommend that you specify TLSv1.1_2016 unless your users are using browsers or devices that do not support TLSv1.1 or later. When both of the following are true, you must specify TLSv1 or later for the security policy:    You're using a custom certificate: you specified a value for ACMCertificateArn or for IAMCertificateId    You're using SNI: you specified sni-only for SSLSupportMethod    If you specify true for CloudFrontDefaultCertificate, CloudFront automatically sets the security policy to TLSv1 regardless of the value that you specify for MinimumProtocolVersion. For information about the relationship between the security policy that you choose and the protocols and ciphers that CloudFront uses to communicate with viewers, see  Supported SSL/TLS Protocols and Ciphers for Communication Between Viewers and CloudFront in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

However, you will incur additional monthly charges.    sni-only: CloudFront can respond to HTTPS requests from viewers that support Server Name Indication (SNI). All modern browsers support SNI, but some browsers still in use don't support SNI. If some of your users' browsers don't support SNI, we recommend that you do one of the following:   Use the vip option (dedicated IP addresses) instead of sni-only.   Use the CloudFront SSL/TLS certificate instead of a custom certificate. This requires that you use the CloudFront domain name of your distribution in the URLs for your objects, for example, https://d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net/logo.png.   If you can control which browser your users use, upgrade the browser to one that supports SNI.   Use HTTP instead of HTTPS.     Don't specify a value for SSLSupportMethod if you specified &lt;CloudFrontDefaultCertificate&gt;true&lt;CloudFrontDefaultCertificate&gt;.
