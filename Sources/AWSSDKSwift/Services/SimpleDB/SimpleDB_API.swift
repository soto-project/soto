/**
Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions of data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and effort associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB provides developers the freedom to focus on application development.  A traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront capital outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive and repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically simpler, requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and providing a simple API for storage and access. This approach eliminates the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and performance tuning. Developers gain access to this functionality within Amazon's proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and pay only for what they use.   Visit http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/ for more information.

    ///   Performs multiple DeleteAttributes operations in a single call, which reduces round trips and latencies. This enables Amazon SimpleDB to optimize requests, which generally yields better throughput.    If you specify BatchDeleteAttributes without attributes or values, all the attributes for the item are deleted.   BatchDeleteAttributes is an idempotent operation; running it multiple times on the same item or attribute doesn't result in an error.   The BatchDeleteAttributes operation succeeds or fails in its entirety. There are no partial deletes. You can execute multiple BatchDeleteAttributes operations and other operations in parallel. However, large numbers of concurrent BatchDeleteAttributes calls can result in Service Unavailable (503) responses.   This operation is vulnerable to exceeding the maximum URL size when making a REST request using the HTTP GET method.   This operation does not support conditions using Expected.X.Name, Expected.X.Value, or Expected.X.Exists.    The following limitations are enforced for this operation:  1 MB request size 25 item limit per BatchDeleteAttributes operation

    ///   The BatchPutAttributes operation creates or replaces attributes within one or more items. By using this operation, the client can perform multiple PutAttribute operation with a single call. This helps yield savings in round trips and latencies, enabling Amazon SimpleDB to optimize requests and generally produce better throughput.   The client may specify the item name with the Item.X.ItemName parameter. The client may specify new attributes using a combination of the Item.X.Attribute.Y.Name and Item.X.Attribute.Y.Value parameters. The client may specify the first attribute for the first item using the parameters Item.0.Attribute.0.Name and Item.0.Attribute.0.Value, and for the second attribute for the first item by the parameters Item.0.Attribute.1.Name and Item.0.Attribute.1.Value, and so on.   Attributes are uniquely identified within an item by their name/value combination. For example, a single item can have the attributes { "first_name", "first_value" } and { "first_name", "second_value" }. However, it cannot have two attribute instances where both the Item.X.Attribute.Y.Name and Item.X.Attribute.Y.Value are the same.   Optionally, the requester can supply the Replace parameter for each individual value. Setting this value to true will cause the new attribute values to replace the existing attribute values. For example, if an item I has the attributes { 'a', '1' }, { 'b', '2'} and { 'b', '3' } and the requester does a BatchPutAttributes of {'I', 'b', '4' } with the Replace parameter set to true, the final attributes of the item will be { 'a', '1' } and { 'b', '4' }, replacing the previous values of the 'b' attribute with the new value.   You cannot specify an empty string as an item or as an attribute name. The BatchPutAttributes operation succeeds or fails in its entirety. There are no partial puts.   This operation is vulnerable to exceeding the maximum URL size when making a REST request using the HTTP GET method. This operation does not support conditions using Expected.X.Name, Expected.X.Value, or Expected.X.Exists.   You can execute multiple BatchPutAttributes operations and other operations in parallel.

However, it cannot have two attribute instances where both the Attribute.X.Name and Attribute.X.Value are the same.   Optionally, the requestor can supply the Replace parameter for each individual attribute. Setting this value to true causes the new attribute value to replace the existing attribute value(s). For example, if an item has the attributes { 'a', '1' }, { 'b', '2'} and { 'b', '3' } and the requestor calls PutAttributes using the attributes { 'b', '4' } with the Replace parameter set to true, the final attributes of the item are changed to { 'a', '1' } and { 'b', '4' }, which replaces the previous values of the 'b' attribute with the new value.   Using PutAttributes to replace attribute values that do not exist will not result in an error response.   You cannot specify an empty string as an attribute name.   Because Amazon SimpleDB makes multiple copies of client data and uses an eventual consistency update model, an immediate GetAttributes or Select operation (read) immediately after a PutAttributes or DeleteAttributes operation (write) might not return the updated data.

For example, if the client asks to retrieve 2500 items, but each individual item is 10 kB in size, the system returns 100 items and an appropriate NextToken so the client can access the next page of results.
