If you try to send email from an address that isn't verified, the operation results in an "Email address not verified" error.   If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you can only send email to other verified addresses in your account, or to addresses that are associated with the Amazon SES mailbox simulator.   The maximum message size, including attachments, is 10 MB.   Each message has to include at least one recipient address. A recipient address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines.   If you send a single message to more than one recipient address, and one of the recipient addresses isn't in a valid format (that is, it's not in the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain), Amazon SES rejects the entire message, even if the other addresses are valid.   Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than 50 recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into groups of less than 50 recipients, and send separate messages to each group.   Amazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding for MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents of your message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit content isn't preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend that you encode all content that isn't 7-bit ASCII. For more information, see MIME Encoding in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.   Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the SendRawEmail operation:   Although you can customize the message headers when using the SendRawEmail operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own Message-ID and Date headers; if you passed these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES provides.   If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, SendRawEmail enables you to specify the cross-account identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can pass optional parameters SourceArn, FromArn, and/or ReturnPathArn to the API, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email:    X-SES-SOURCE-ARN     X-SES-FROM-ARN     X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN     Don't include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the email.  If you only specify the SourceIdentityArn parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you specified. For more information about sending authorization, see the Using Sending Authorization with Amazon SES in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.    For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your sending quota). For more information about sending quotas in Amazon SES, see Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.

    ///  Composes an email message using an email template and immediately queues it for sending. In order to send email using the SendTemplatedEmail operation, your call to the API must meet the following requirements:   The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create email templates using the CreateTemplate operation.   The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.   If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to verified addresses or domains, or to email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see Verifying Email Addresses and Domains in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.    The maximum message size is 10 MB.   Calls to the SendTemplatedEmail operation may only include one Destination parameter. A destination is a set of recipients who will receive the same version of the email. The Destination parameter can include up to 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields.   The Destination parameter must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain), the entire message will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipients that are valid.    If your call to the SendTemplatedEmail operation includes all of the required parameters, Amazon SES accepts it and returns a Message ID. However, if Amazon SES can't render the email because the template contains errors, it doesn't send the email. Additionally, because it already accepted the message, Amazon SES doesn't return a message stating that it was unable to send the email. For these reasons, we highly recommend that you set up Amazon SES to send you notifications when Rendering Failure events occur. For more information, see Sending Personalized Email Using the Amazon SES API in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.
