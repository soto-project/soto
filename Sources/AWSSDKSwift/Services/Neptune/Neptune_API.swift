/**
Amazon Neptune    Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency. Amazon Neptune supports popular graph models Property Graph and W3C's RDF, and their respective query languages Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL, allowing you to easily build queries that efficiently navigate highly connected datasets. Neptune powers graph use cases such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug discovery, and network security.  This interface reference for Amazon Neptune contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon Neptune. Note that Amazon Neptune is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user guide.  Amazon Neptune API Reference

    ///  Copies a snapshot of a DB cluster. To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot, SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot. You can copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS Region. In that case, the AWS Region where you call the CopyDBClusterSnapshot action is the destination AWS Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied to. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS Region, you must provide the following values:    KmsKeyId - The AWS Key Management System (AWS KMS) key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region.    PreSignedUrl - A URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the CopyDBClusterSnapshot action to be called in the source AWS Region where the DB cluster snapshot is copied from. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBClusterSnapshot API action that can be executed in the source AWS Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:    KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region. This is the same identifier for both the CopyDBClusterSnapshot action that is called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL.    DestinationRegion - The name of the AWS Region that the DB cluster snapshot will be created in.    SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:neptune-cluster1-snapshot-20161115.   To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see  Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (AWS Signature Version 4) and  Signature Version 4 Signing Process.    TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The identifier for the new copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region.    SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the ARN format for the source AWS Region and is the same value as the SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier in the pre-signed URL.    To cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the target DB cluster snapshot identified by TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier while that DB cluster snapshot is in "copying" status.
