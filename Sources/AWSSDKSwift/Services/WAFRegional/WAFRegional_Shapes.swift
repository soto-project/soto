Valid values depend on the values that you specified for FieldToMatch:    HEADER: The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that you specified in FieldToMatch, for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header.    METHOD: The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the request. CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, and PUT.    QUERY_STRING: The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character.    URI: The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg.    BODY: The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see CreateSizeConstraintSet.     SINGLE_QUERY_ARG: The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion. The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.    ALL_QUERY_ARGS: Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG, but instead of inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString.   If TargetString includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.  If you're using the AWS WAF API  Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes. For example, suppose the value of Type is HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent. If you want to search the User-Agent header for the value BadBot, you base64-encode BadBot using MIME base64 encoding and include the resulting value, QmFkQm90, in the value of TargetString.  If you're using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs  The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

CMD_LINE  When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:   Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^   Delete spaces before the following characters: / (   Replace the following characters with a space: , ;   Replace multiple spaces with one space   Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)    COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  Use this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):   \f, formfeed, decimal 12   \t, tab, decimal 9   \n, newline, decimal 10   \r, carriage return, decimal 13   \v, vertical tab, decimal 11   non-breaking space, decimal 160    COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  Use this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs the following operations:   Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "    Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160   Replaces (ampersand)lt; with a "less than" symbol   Replaces (ampersand)gt; with &gt;    Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;, with the corresponding characters   Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn;, with the corresponding characters    LOWERCASE  Use this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).  URL_DECODE  Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.  NONE  Specify NONE if you don't want to perform any text transformations.
