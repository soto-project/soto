/**
Client object for interacting with AWS Health service.

AWS Health The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health information that appears in the AWS Personal Health Dashboard. You can use the API operations to get information about AWS Health events that affect your AWS services and resources.  You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan from AWS Support to use the AWS Health API. If you call the AWS Health API from an AWS account that doesn't have a Business or Enterprise support plan, you receive a SubscriptionRequiredException error.  AWS Health has a single endpoint: health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS). Use this endpoint to call the AWS Health API operations. For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the Signature Version 4 Signing Process. If your AWS account is part of AWS Organizations, you can use the AWS Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a centralized view of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization. You can aggregate AWS Health events in real time to identify accounts in your organization that are affected by an operational event or get notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API operations to enable this feature and return event information. For more information, see Aggregating AWS Health events in the AWS Health User Guide.  When you use the AWS Health API operations to return AWS Health events, see the following recommendations:   Use the eventScopeCode parameter to specify whether to return AWS Health events that are public or account-specific.   Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if you call the DescribeEventsForOrganization operation to get all events in your organization, you might receive several page results. Specify the nextToken in the next request to return more results.

To do this, call the EnableHealthServiceAccessForOrganization operation from your organization's master account. When you call the DescribeEventDetailsForOrganization operation, you specify the organizationEventDetailFilters object in the request. Depending on the AWS Health event type, note the following differences:   If the event is public, the awsAccountId parameter must be empty. If you specify an account ID for a public event, then an error message is returned. That's because the event might apply to all AWS accounts and isn't specific to an account in your organization.   If the event is specific to an account, then you must specify the awsAccountId parameter in the request. If you don't specify an account ID, an error message returns because the event is specific to an AWS account in your organization.    For more information, see Event.

You must use the IAM console, API, or AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to remove the SLR. For more information, see Deleting a Service-Linked Role in the IAM User Guide.  You can also disable the organizational feature by using the Organizations DisableAWSServiceAccess API operation. After you call this operation, AWS Health stops aggregating events for all other AWS accounts in your organization. If you call the AWS Health API operations for organizational view, AWS Health returns an error. AWS Health continues to aggregate health events for your AWS account.
