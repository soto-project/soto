/**
Client object for interacting with AWS SSM service.

AWS Systems Manager AWS Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as collecting system inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed instances. A managed instance is any Amazon EC2 instance or on-premises machine in your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems Manager. This reference is intended to be used with the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. To get started, verify prerequisites and configure managed instances. For more information, see Setting Up AWS Systems Manager in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. For information about other API actions you can perform on Amazon EC2 instances, see the Amazon EC2 API Reference. For information about how to use a Query API, see Making API Requests.

    //MARK: API Calls

    ///  Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your documents, managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level. For example: Key=Owner and Value=DbAdmin, SysAdmin, or Dev. Or Key=Stack and Value=Production, Pre-Production, or Test. Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags.  We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon EC2 and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters.  For more information about tags, see Tagging Your Amazon EC2 Resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

For more information about requirements for managing on-premises instances and VMs using Systems Manager, see Setting Up AWS Systems Manager for Hybrid Environments in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide.

For more information, see Configuring Resource Data Sync for Inventory in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. You can configure Systems Manager Explorer to use the SyncFromSource type to synchronize operational work items (OpsItems) and operational data (OpsData) from multiple AWS Regions to a single Amazon S3 bucket. This type can synchronize OpsItems and OpsData from multiple AWS accounts and Regions or EntireOrganization by using AWS Organizations. For more information, see Setting Up Explorer to Display Data from Multiple Accounts and Regions in the AWS Systems Manager User Guide. A resource data sync is an asynchronous operation that returns immediately. After a successful initial sync is completed, the system continuously syncs data. To check the status of a sync, use the ListResourceDataSync.  By default, data is not encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also recommend that you secure access to the Amazon S3 bucket by creating a restrictive bucket policy.

    ///   ServiceSetting is an account-level setting for an AWS service. This setting defines how a user interacts with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an AWS service charges money to the account based on feature or service usage, then the AWS service team might create a default setting of "false". This means the user can't use this feature unless they change the setting to "true" and intentionally opt in for a paid feature. Services map a SettingId object to a setting value. AWS services teams define the default value for a SettingId. You can't create a new SettingId, but you can overwrite the default value if you have the ssm:UpdateServiceSetting permission for the setting. Use the GetServiceSetting API action to view the current value. Or, use the ResetServiceSetting to change the value back to the original value defined by the AWS service team. Update the service setting for the account.
