/**
Client object for interacting with AWS ACMPCA service.

This is the ACM Private CA API Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types involved in creating and managing private certificate authorities (CA) for your organization. The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs.  Each ACM Private CA API action has a throttling limit which determines the number of times the action can be called per second. For more information, see API Rate Limits in ACM Private CA in the ACM Private CA user guide.

    ///  Creates a root or subordinate private certificate authority (CA). You must specify the CA configuration, the certificate revocation list (CRL) configuration, the CA type, and an optional idempotency token to avoid accidental creation of multiple CAs. The CA configuration specifies the name of the algorithm and key size to be used to create the CA private key, the type of signing algorithm that the CA uses, and X.500 subject information. The CRL configuration specifies the CRL expiration period in days (the validity period of the CRL), the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the CRL, and a CNAME alias for the S3 bucket that is included in certificates issued by the CA. If successful, this action returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA.

    ///  Assigns permissions from a private CA to a designated AWS service. Services are specified by their service principals and can be given permission to create and retrieve certificates on a private CA. Services can also be given permission to list the active permissions that the private CA has granted. For ACM to automatically renew your private CA's certificates, you must assign all possible permissions from the CA to the ACM service principal. At this time, you can only assign permissions to ACM (acm.amazonaws.com). Permissions can be revoked with the DeletePermission action and listed with the ListPermissions action.

    ///  Deletes a private certificate authority (CA). You must provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the private CA that you want to delete. You can find the ARN by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action.   Deleting a CA will invalidate other CAs and certificates below it in your CA hierarchy.  Before you can delete a CA that you have created and activated, you must disable it. To do this, call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action and set the CertificateAuthorityStatus parameter to DISABLED.  Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be created (that is, the status of the CA is CREATING). You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported the signed certificate into ACM Private CA (that is, the status of the CA is PENDING_CERTIFICATE).  When you successfully call DeleteCertificateAuthority, the CA's status changes to DELETED. However, the CA won't be permanently deleted until the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do not set the PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set the parameter from 7 to 30 days. The DescribeCertificateAuthority action returns the time remaining in the restoration window of a private CA in the DELETED state. To restore an eligible CA, call the RestoreCertificateAuthority action.

DISABLED - Your private CA has been disabled.    EXPIRED - Your private CA certificate has expired.    FAILED - Your private CA has failed. Your CA can fail because of problems such a network outage or backend AWS failure or other errors. A failed CA can never return to the pending state. You must create a new CA.

Sign the CSR using a root or intermediate CA hosted either by an on-premises PKI hierarchy or a commercial CA..   Create a certificate chain and copy the signed certificate and the certificate chain to your working directory.   The following requirements apply when you import a CA certificate.   You cannot import a non-self-signed certificate for use as a root CA.   You cannot import a self-signed certificate for use as a subordinate CA.   Your certificate chain must not include the private CA certificate that you are importing.   Your ACM Private CA-hosted or on-premises CA certificate must be the last certificate in your chain.
