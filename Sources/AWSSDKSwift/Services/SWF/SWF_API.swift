/**
Amazon Simple Workflow Service The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application. Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state. This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the Amazon SWF programming model, see the  Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

If the type already exists, then a TypeAlreadyExists fault is returned. You cannot change the configuration settings of a workflow type once it is registered and it must be registered as a new version.   Access Control  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:   Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.   Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to call this action.   Constrain the following parameters by using a Condition element with the appropriate keys.    defaultTaskList.name: String constraint. The key is swf:defaultTaskList.name.    name: String constraint. The key is swf:name.    version: String constraint. The key is swf:version.     If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED.

If the runId isn't specified, the WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event is recorded in the history of the current open workflow execution with the specified workflowId in the domain.   Because this action allows the workflow to properly clean up and gracefully close, it should be used instead of TerminateWorkflowExecution when possible.

Access Control  If an IAM policy grants permission to use RespondDecisionTaskCompleted, it can express permissions for the list of decisions in the decisions parameter. Each of the decisions has one or more parameters, much like a regular API call. To allow for policies to be as readable as possible, you can express permissions on decisions as if they were actual API calls, including applying conditions to some parameters.
