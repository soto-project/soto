This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting, the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role in the IAM User Guide. By default, the value is set to 3600 seconds.   The DurationSeconds parameter is separate from the duration of a console session that you might request using the returned credentials. The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a SessionDuration parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session. For more information, see Creating a URL that Enables Federated Users to Access the AWS Management Console in the IAM User Guide.

        /// A unique identifier that is used by third parties when assuming roles in their customers' accounts. For each role that the third party can assume, they should instruct their customers to ensure the role's trust policy checks for the external ID that the third party generated. Each time the third party assumes the role, they should pass the customer's external ID. The external ID is useful in order to help third parties bind a role to the customer who created it. For more information about the external ID, see How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources to a Third Party in the IAM User Guide. The regex used to validated this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-

If you pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are allowed by both (the intersection of) the access policy of the role that is being assumed, and the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity in the IAM User Guide. The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a string of characters up to 2048 characters in length. The characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\u0020-\u00FF). It can also include the tab (\u0009), linefeed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) characters.  The policy plain text must be 2048 bytes or shorter. However, an internal conversion compresses it into a packed binary format with a separate limit. The PackedPolicySize response element indicates by percentage how close to the upper size limit the policy is, with 100% equaling the maximum allowed size.

This means that subsequent cross-account API requests using the temporary security credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in their CloudTrail logs.
