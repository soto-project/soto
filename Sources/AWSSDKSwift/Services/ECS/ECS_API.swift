/**
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage by using the EC2 launch type. For more information about launch types, see Amazon ECS Launch Types. Amazon ECS lets you launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features. You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.

However, you can create your own cluster with a unique name with the CreateCluster action.  When you call the CreateCluster API operation, Amazon ECS attempts to create the service-linked role for your account so that required resources in other AWS services can be managed on your behalf. However, if the IAM user that makes the call does not have permissions to create the service-linked role, it is not created. For more information, see Using Service-Linked Roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

    ///  Runs and maintains a desired number of tasks from a specified task definition. If the number of tasks running in a service drops below desiredCount, Amazon ECS spawns another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see UpdateService. In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see Service Load Balancing in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing properties, such as the task definition or the desired count of a service, with an UpdateService operation. If a service is using the ECS deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the RUNNING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler may stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state; tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and they are reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%. If a service is using the ECS deployment controller, the maximum percent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the RUNNING or PENDING state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the DRAINING state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%. If a service is using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values are only used to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the RUNNING state while the container instances are in the DRAINING state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values are not used, although they are currently visible when describing your service. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that do use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for a replica service for minimumHealthyPercent is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for minimumHealthyPercent is 0%. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following logic:   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy) with the placementStrategy parameter):   Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for this service in their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.

When you delete a service, if there are still running tasks that require cleanup, the service status moves from ACTIVE to DRAINING, and the service is no longer visible in the console or in the ListServices API operation. After the tasks have stopped, then the service status moves from DRAINING to INACTIVE. Services in the DRAINING or INACTIVE status can still be viewed with the DescribeServices API operation. However, in the future, INACTIVE services may be cleaned up and purged from Amazon ECS record keeping, and DescribeServices calls on those services return a ServiceNotFoundException error.

Alternatively, you can use StartTask to use your own scheduler or place tasks manually on specific container instances. The Amazon ECS API follows an eventual consistency model, due to the distributed nature of the system supporting the API. This means that the result of an API command you run that affects your Amazon ECS resources might not be immediately visible to all subsequent commands you run. Keep this in mind when you carry out an API command that immediately follows a previous API command. To manage eventual consistency, you can do the following:   Confirm the state of the resource before you run a command to modify it. Run the DescribeTasks command using an exponential backoff algorithm to ensure that you allow enough time for the previous command to propagate through the system. To do this, run the DescribeTasks command repeatedly, starting with a couple of seconds of wait time and increasing gradually up to five minutes of wait time.   Add wait time between subsequent commands, even if the DescribeTasks command returns an accurate response. Apply an exponential backoff algorithm starting with a couple of seconds of wait time, and increase gradually up to about five minutes of wait time.

You can change the status of a container instance to DRAINING to manually remove an instance from a cluster, for example to perform system updates, update the Docker daemon, or scale down the cluster size.  When you set a container instance to DRAINING, Amazon ECS prevents new tasks from being scheduled for placement on the container instance and replacement service tasks are started on other container instances in the cluster if the resources are available. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the PENDING state are stopped immediately. Service tasks on the container instance that are in the RUNNING state are stopped and replaced according to the service's deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent. You can change the deployment configuration of your service using UpdateService.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during task replacement. For example, desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. If the minimum is 100%, the service scheduler can't remove existing tasks until the replacement tasks are considered healthy. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.   The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during task replacement, which enables you to define the replacement batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four tasks to be drained, provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available. If the maximum is 100%, then replacement tasks can't start until the draining tasks have stopped.   Any PENDING or RUNNING tasks that do not belong to a service are not affected. You must wait for them to finish or stop them manually. A container instance has completed draining when it has no more RUNNING tasks. You can verify this using ListTasks. When you set a container instance to ACTIVE, the Amazon ECS scheduler can begin scheduling tasks on the instance again.

If the network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, a new AWS CodeDeploy deployment should be created. For more information, see CreateDeployment in the AWS CodeDeploy API Reference. You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the cluster that the service is running in and a new desiredCount parameter. If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy.  If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for example, my_image:latest), you do not need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can update the service using the forceNewDeployment option. The new tasks launched by the deployment pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start.  You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters, minimumHealthyPercent and maximumPercent, to determine the deployment strategy.   If minimumHealthyPercent is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore desiredCount temporarily during a deployment. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state. Tasks for services that use a load balancer are considered healthy if they are in the RUNNING state and the container instance they are hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.   The maximumPercent parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if desiredCount is four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available).   When UpdateService stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of docker stop is issued to the containers running in the task. This results in a SIGTERM and a 30-second timeout, after which SIGKILL is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the SIGTERM gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no SIGKILL is sent. When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following logic:   Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).   By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although you can choose a different placement strategy):   Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.   Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.     When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in your cluster using the following logic:    Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two, container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination.   Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring container instances with the largest number of running tasks for this service.
