Example: Assume 'variable a' holds 10 and 'variable b' holds 20.  (a = b) is not true.  &lt; &gt;  Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not; if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true. Example: (a &lt; &gt; b) is true.  &gt;  Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true. Example: (a &gt; b) is not true.  &lt;  Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true. Example: (a &lt; b) is true.  &gt;=  Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true. Example: (a &gt;= b) is not true.  &lt;=  Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand; if yes, then the condition becomes true. Example: (a &lt;= b) is true.  AND, OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, NOT, IS NULL  Logical operators.    Supported Partition Key Types: The following are the the supported partition keys.    string     date     timestamp     int     bigint     long     tinyint     smallint     decimal    If an invalid type is encountered, an exception is thrown.  The following list shows the valid operators on each type. When you define a crawler, the partitionKey type is created as a STRING, to be compatible with the catalog partitions.   Sample API Call:
