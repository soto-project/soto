You can use Code Signing for Amazon FreeRTOS (AWS Signer) to sign code that you created for any of the IoT devices that Amazon Web Services supports. AWS Signer is integrated with Amazon FreeRTOS, AWS Certificate Manager, and AWS CloudTrail. Amazon FreeRTOS customers can use AWS Signer to sign code images before making them available for microcontrollers. You can use ACM to import third-party certificates to be used by AWS Signer. For general information about using AWS Signer, see the Code Signing for Amazon FreeRTOS Developer Guide.

Your S3 source bucket must be version enabled.   You must create an S3 destination bucket. AWS Signer uses your S3 destination bucket to write your signed code.   You specify the name of the source and destination buckets when calling the StartSigningJob operation.   You must also specify a request token that identifies your request to AWS Signer.    You can call the DescribeSigningJob and the ListSigningJobs actions after you call StartSigningJob.
