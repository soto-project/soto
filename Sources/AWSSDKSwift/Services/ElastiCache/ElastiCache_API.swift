/**
Client object for interacting with AWS ElastiCache service.

Amazon ElastiCache Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a distributed cache in the cloud. With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance, in-memory cache with less of the administrative burden involved in launching and managing a distributed cache. The service makes setup, scaling, and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache deployment. In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced visibility into the key performance statistics associated with their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.

Note the following    A customer can use this operation to test automatic failover on up to 5 shards (called node groups in the ElastiCache API and AWS CLI) in any rolling 24-hour period.   If calling this operation on shards in different clusters (called replication groups in the API and CLI), the calls can be made concurrently.     If calling this operation multiple times on different shards in the same Redis (cluster mode enabled) replication group, the first node replacement must complete before a subsequent call can be made.   To determine whether the node replacement is complete you can check Events using the Amazon ElastiCache console, the AWS CLI, or the ElastiCache API. Look for the following automatic failover related events, listed here in order of occurrance:   Replication group message: Test Failover API called for node group &lt;node-group-id&gt;    Cache cluster message: Failover from master node &lt;primary-node-id&gt; to replica node &lt;node-id&gt; completed    Replication group message: Failover from master node &lt;primary-node-id&gt; to replica node &lt;node-id&gt; completed    Cache cluster message: Recovering cache nodes &lt;node-id&gt;    Cache cluster message: Finished recovery for cache nodes &lt;node-id&gt;    For more information see:    Viewing ElastiCache Events in the ElastiCache User Guide     DescribeEvents in the ElastiCache API Reference     Also see, Testing Multi-AZ  in the ElastiCache User Guide.
