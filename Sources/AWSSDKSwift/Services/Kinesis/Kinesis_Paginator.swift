    ///  Describes the specified Kinesis data stream. The information returned includes the stream name, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), creation time, enhanced metric configuration, and shard map. The shard map is an array of shard objects. For each shard object, there is the hash key and sequence number ranges that the shard spans, and the IDs of any earlier shards that played in a role in creating the shard. Every record ingested in the stream is identified by a sequence number, which is assigned when the record is put into the stream. You can limit the number of shards returned by each call. For more information, see Retrieving Shards from a Stream in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide. There are no guarantees about the chronological order shards returned. To process shards in chronological order, use the ID of the parent shard to track the lineage to the oldest shard. This operation has a limit of 10 transactions per second per account.

    ///  Lists your Kinesis data streams. The number of streams may be too large to return from a single call to ListStreams. You can limit the number of returned streams using the Limit parameter. If you do not specify a value for the Limit parameter, Kinesis Data Streams uses the default limit, which is currently 10. You can detect if there are more streams available to list by using the HasMoreStreams flag from the returned output. If there are more streams available, you can request more streams by using the name of the last stream returned by the ListStreams request in the ExclusiveStartStreamName parameter in a subsequent request to ListStreams. The group of stream names returned by the subsequent request is then added to the list. You can continue this process until all the stream names have been collected in the list.   ListStreams has a limit of five transactions per second per account.
