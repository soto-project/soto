You can specify the following values:  MULTIVALUE  If you define a health check for the service and the health check is healthy, Route 53 returns the applicable value for up to eight instances. For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with IP addresses for up to eight healthy instances. If fewer than eight instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to every DNS query with the IP addresses for all of the healthy instances. If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the values for up to eight instances. For more information about the multivalue routing policy, see Multivalue Answer Routing in the Route 53 Developer Guide.  WEIGHTED  Route 53 returns the applicable value from one randomly selected instance from among the instances that you registered using the same service. Currently, all records have the same weight, so you can't route more or less traffic to any instances. For example, suppose the service includes configurations for one A record and a health check, and you use the service to register 10 instances. Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the IP address for one randomly selected instance from among the healthy instances. If no instances are healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries as if all of the instances were healthy. If you don't define a health check for the service, Route 53 assumes that all instances are healthy and returns the applicable value for one randomly selected instance. For more information about the weighted routing policy, see Weighted Routing in the Route 53 Developer Guide.

All records: You specify settings other than TTL and Type when you register an instance.   The following values are supported:  A  Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv4 format, such as 192.0.2.44.  AAAA  Route 53 returns the IP address of the resource in IPv6 format, such as 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345.  CNAME  Route 53 returns the domain name of the resource, such as www.example.com. Note the following:   You specify the domain name that you want to route traffic to when you register an instance. For more information, see RegisterInstanceRequest$Attributes.   You must specify WEIGHTED for the value of RoutingPolicy.   You can't specify both CNAME for Type and settings for HealthCheckConfig. If you do, the request will fail with an InvalidInput error.    SRV  Route 53 returns the value for an SRV record. The value for an SRV record uses the following values:  priority weight port service-hostname  Note the following about the values:   The values of priority and weight are both set to 1 and can't be changed.    The value of port comes from the value that you specify for the AWS_INSTANCE_PORT attribute when you submit a RegisterInstance request.    The value of service-hostname is a concatenation of the following values:   The value that you specify for InstanceId when you register an instance.   The name of the service.   The name of the namespace.    For example, if the value of InstanceId is test, the name of the service is backend, and the name of the namespace is example.com, the value of service-hostname is:  test.backend.example.com    If you specify settings for an SRV record and if you specify values for AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4, AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6, or both in the RegisterInstance request, AWS Cloud Map automatically creates A and/or AAAA records that have the same name as the value of service-hostname in the SRV record. You can ignore these records.

For each attribute, the applicable value.   Supported attribute keys include the following:  AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME     If you want AWS Cloud Map to create an Amazon Route 53 alias record that routes traffic to an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. For information about how to get the DNS name, see "DNSName" in the topic AliasTarget in the Route 53 API Reference. Note the following:   The configuration for the service that is specified by ServiceId must include settings for an A record, an AAAA record, or both.   In the service that is specified by ServiceId, the value of RoutingPolicy must be WEIGHTED.   If the service that is specified by ServiceId includes HealthCheckConfig settings, AWS Cloud Map will create the Route 53 health check, but it won't associate the health check with the alias record.   Auto naming currently doesn't support creating alias records that route traffic to AWS resources other than ELB load balancers.   If you specify a value for AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME, don't specify values for any of the AWS_INSTANCE attributes.    AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS  If the service configuration includes HealthCheckCustomConfig, you can optionally use AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS to specify the initial status of the custom health check, HEALTHY or UNHEALTHY. If you don't specify a value for AWS_INIT_HEALTH_STATUS, the initial status is HEALTHY.  AWS_INSTANCE_CNAME  If the service configuration includes a CNAME record, the domain name that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, example.com. This value is required if the service specified by ServiceId includes settings for an CNAME record.  AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4  If the service configuration includes an A record, the IPv4 address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, 192.0.2.44. This value is required if the service specified by ServiceId includes settings for an A record. If the service includes settings for an SRV record, you must specify a value for AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4, AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6, or both.  AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6  If the service configuration includes an AAAA record, the IPv6 address that you want Route 53 to return in response to DNS queries, for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. This value is required if the service specified by ServiceId includes settings for an AAAA record. If the service includes settings for an SRV record, you must specify a value for AWS_INSTANCE_IPV4, AWS_INSTANCE_IPV6, or both.  AWS_INSTANCE_PORT  If the service includes an SRV record, the value that you want Route 53 to return for the port. If the service includes HealthCheckConfig, the port on the endpoint that you want Route 53 to send requests to.  This value is required if you specified settings for an SRV record when you created the service.  Custom attributes  You can add up to 30 custom attributes. For each key-value pair, the maximum length of the attribute name is 255 characters, and the maximum length of the attribute value is 1,024 characters.

For more information, see DnsRecord$Type.   You can use this value to update an existing instance.   To register a new instance, you must specify a value that is unique among instances that you register by using the same service.    If you specify an existing InstanceId and ServiceId, AWS Cloud Map updates the existing DNS records, if any. If there's also an existing health check, AWS Cloud Map deletes the old health check and creates a new one.   The health check isn't deleted immediately, so it will still appear for a while if you submit a ListHealthChecks request, for example.
