        ///  Alias resource record sets only: The value that you specify depends on where you want to route queries:  CloudFront distribution  Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you created your distribution. Your CloudFront distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the resource record set. For example, if the name of the resource record set is acme.example.com, your CloudFront distribution must include acme.example.com as one of the alternate domain names. For more information, see Using Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.  For failover alias records, you can't specify a CloudFront distribution for both the primary and secondary records. A distribution must include an alternate domain name that matches the name of the record. However, the primary and secondary records have the same name, and you can't include the same alternate domain name in more than one distribution.    Elastic Beanstalk environment  If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment includes the region that you deployed the environment in, you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the environment. For example, the domain name my-environment.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com is a regionalized domain name.   For environments that were created before early 2016, the domain name doesn't include the region. To route traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME record instead of an alias record. Note that you can't create a CNAME record for the root domain name. For example, if your domain name is example.com, you can create a record that routes traffic for acme.example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you can't create a record that routes traffic for example.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.  For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains, specify the CNAME attribute for the environment. You can use the following methods to get the value of the CNAME attribute:    AWS Management Console: For information about how to get the value by using the console, see Using Custom Domains with AWS Elastic Beanstalk in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide.    Elastic Beanstalk API: Use the DescribeEnvironments action to get the value of the CNAME attribute. For more information, see DescribeEnvironments in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk API Reference.    AWS CLI: Use the describe-environments command to get the value of the CNAME attribute. For more information, see describe-environments in the AWS Command Line Interface Reference.    ELB load balancer  Specify the DNS name that is associated with the load balancer. Get the DNS name by using the AWS Management Console, the ELB API, or the AWS CLI.     AWS Management Console: Go to the EC2 page, choose Load Balancers in the navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the Description tab, and get the value of the DNS name field. (If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins with dualstack.)     Elastic Load Balancing API: Use DescribeLoadBalancers to get the value of DNSName. For more information, see the applicable guide:   Classic Load Balancers: DescribeLoadBalancers    Application and Network Load Balancers: DescribeLoadBalancers       AWS CLI: Use describe-load-balancers to get the value of DNSName. For more information, see the applicable guide:   Classic Load Balancers: describe-load-balancers    Application and Network Load Balancers: describe-load-balancers       Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website  Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint that you created the bucket in, for example, s3-website-us-east-2.amazonaws.com. For more information about valid values, see the table Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) Website Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. For more information about using S3 buckets for websites, see Getting Started with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.   Another Route 53 resource record set  Specify the value of the Name element for a resource record set in the current hosted zone.  If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the zone apex), you can't specify the domain name for a record for which the value of Type is CNAME. This is because the alias record must have the same type as the record that you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported even for an alias record.   
        public let dNSName: String
        ///  Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted alias resource record sets: When EvaluateTargetHealth is true, an alias resource record set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB load balancer or another resource record set in the hosted zone. Note the following:  CloudFront distributions  You can't set EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target is a CloudFront distribution.  Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized subdomains  If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in DNSName and the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2 instance.) If you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any.  If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.  ELB load balancers  Health checking behavior depends on the type of load balancer:    Classic Load Balancers: If you specify an ELB Classic Load Balancer in DNSName, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. If you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.    Application and Network Load Balancers: If you specify an ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true, Route 53 routes queries to the load balancer based on the health of the target groups that are associated with the load balancer:   For an Application or Network Load Balancer to be considered healthy, every target group that contains targets must contain at least one healthy target. If any target group contains only unhealthy targets, the load balancer is considered unhealthy, and Route 53 routes queries to other resources.   A target group that has no registered targets is considered healthy.      When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer.    S3 buckets  There are no special requirements for setting EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target is an S3 bucket.  Other records in the same hosted zone  If the AWS resource that you specify in DNSName is a record or a group of records (for example, a group of weighted records) but is not another alias record, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the records in the alias target. For more information, see What Happens When You Omit Health Checks? in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.   For more information and examples, see Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

Alias resource record sets for CloudFront can't be created in a private zone.   Elastic Beanstalk environment  Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the environment in. The environment must have a regionalized subdomain. For a list of regions and the corresponding hosted zone IDs, see AWS Elastic Beanstalk in the "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the Amazon Web Services General Reference.  ELB load balancer  Specify the value of the hosted zone ID for the load balancer. Use the following methods to get the hosted zone ID:    Elastic Load Balancing table in the "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the Amazon Web Services General Reference: Use the value that corresponds with the region that you created your load balancer in. Note that there are separate columns for Application and Classic Load Balancers and for Network Load Balancers.    AWS Management Console: Go to the Amazon EC2 page, choose Load Balancers in the navigation pane, select the load balancer, and get the value of the Hosted zone field on the Description tab.    Elastic Load Balancing API: Use DescribeLoadBalancers to get the applicable value. For more information, see the applicable guide:   Classic Load Balancers: Use DescribeLoadBalancers to get the value of CanonicalHostedZoneNameId.   Application and Network Load Balancers: Use DescribeLoadBalancers to get the value of CanonicalHostedZoneId.      AWS CLI: Use describe-load-balancers to get the applicable value. For more information, see the applicable guide:   Classic Load Balancers: Use describe-load-balancers to get the value of CanonicalHostedZoneNameId.   Application and Network Load Balancers: Use describe-load-balancers to get the value of CanonicalHostedZoneId.      An Amazon S3 bucket configured as a static website  Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the bucket in. For more information about valid values, see the Amazon Simple Storage Service Website Endpoints table in the "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms: Route 53 stops monitoring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the corresponding resources.

A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid. The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the Common Name field and possibly several more in the Subject Alternative Names field. One of the domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName. If the endpoint responds to the client_hello message with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in FullyQualifiedDomainName, a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit FullyQualifiedDomainName from the client_hello message.

If you don't specify a value for FailureThreshold, the default value is three health checks.
        public let failureThreshold: Int32?
        /// Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for IPAddress.  If you specify a value for IPAddress: Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks. When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:   If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.    If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type, Route 53 passes FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the preceding cases.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress : Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify for RequestInterval. Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName, the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.  If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).  In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.  In addition, if the value that you specify for Type is HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for IPAddress. If the value of Type is TCP, Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.
        public let fullyQualifiedDomainName: String?
        /// The number of child health checks that are associated with a CALCULATED health that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the CALCULATED health check to be considered healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a CALCULATED health check, use the HealthCheckConfig$ChildHealthChecks and HealthCheckConfig$ChildHealthChecks elements. Note the following:   If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always considers this health check to be unhealthy.   If you specify 0, Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.  
        public let healthThreshold: Int32?
        /// The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks on. If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress:     IPv4 address: four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44.    IPv6 address: eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345.   If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for IPAddress. This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change. For more information, see HealthCheckConfig$FullyQualifiedDomainName. Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:    RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses     RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space     RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses    When the value of Type is CALCULATED or CLOUDWATCH_METRIC, omit IPAddress.

If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.  If you specify HTTPS for the value of Type, the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later.     HTTP_STR_MATCH: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that you specify in SearchString.    HTTPS_STR_MATCH: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that you specify in SearchString.    TCP: Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.    CLOUDWATCH_METRIC: The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the state of the alarm is OK, the health check is considered healthy. If the state is ALARM, the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient data to determine whether the state is OK or ALARM, the health check status depends on the setting for InsufficientDataHealthStatus: Healthy, Unhealthy, or LastKnownStatus.     CALCULATED: For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Route 53 adds up the number of health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and compares that number with the value of HealthThreshold.

In addition, you include the HealthCheckId element and specify the health check that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each resource record set. Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you have included the HealthCheckId element in both resource record sets:   When the primary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the secondary resource record set.   When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary resource record set.   When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the primary resource record set.   If you omit the HealthCheckId element for the secondary resource record set, and if the primary resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of the health of the associated endpoint.   You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements as failover resource record sets. For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the EvaluateTargetHealth element and set the value to true.

For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of 192.0.2.111, create a resource record set with a Type of A and a ContinentCode of AF.  Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not supported.  If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource. You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location. The value * in the CountryCode element matches all geographic locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements.  Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode is *, which handles both queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a * resource record set, Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations.  You can't create non-geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements as geolocation resource record sets.

When you add a HealthCheckId element to a resource record set, Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.   For more information, see the following topics in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide:    How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy     Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover     Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone     When to Specify HealthCheckId  Specifying a value for HealthCheckId is useful only when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks makes sense only in the following configurations:    Non-alias resource record sets: You're checking the health of a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A) and you specify health check IDs for all the resource record sets.  If the health check status for a resource record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with. If the health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the value for that resource record set. If the health check status for all resource record sets in the group is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all resource record sets in the group healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.     Alias resource record sets: You specify the following settings:   You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for an alias resource record set in a group of resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type (such as multiple weighted records named www.example.com with a type of A).    You configure the alias resource record set to route traffic to a non-alias resource record set in the same hosted zone.   You specify a health check ID for the non-alias resource record set.    If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the alias resource record set to be healthy and includes the alias record among the records that it responds to DNS queries with. If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53 stops responding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.  The alias resource record set can also route traffic to a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the same routing policy, name, and type. In that configuration, associate health checks with all of the resource record sets in the group of non-alias resource record sets.     Geolocation Routing  For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the entire United States, for North America, and a resource record set that has * for CountryCode is *, which applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy resource record sets in the following order until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:   The United States   North America   The default resource record set    Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name  If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).  Health check results will be unpredictable if you do the following:   Create a health check that has the same value for FullyQualifiedDomainName as the name of a resource record set.   Associate that health check with the resource record set.   
        public let healthCheckId: String?
        ///  Multivalue answer resource record sets only: To route traffic approximately randomly to multiple resources, such as web servers, create one multivalue answer record for each resource and specify true for MultiValueAnswer. Note the following:   If you associate a health check with a multivalue answer resource record set, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the corresponding IP address only when the health check is healthy.   If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue answer record, Route 53 always considers the record to be healthy.   Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records; if you have eight or fewer healthy records, Route 53 responds to all DNS queries with all the healthy records.   If you have more than eight healthy records, Route 53 responds to different DNS resolvers with different combinations of healthy records.   When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries with up to eight unhealthy records.   If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a response, client software typically tries another of the IP addresses in the response.   You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

You can optionally include a trailing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 assumes that the domain name that you specify is fully qualified. This means that Route 53 treats www.example.com (without a trailing dot) and www.example.com. (with a trailing dot) as identical. For information about how to specify characters other than a-z, 0-9, and - (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see DNS Domain Name Format in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard to replace the leftmost label in a domain name, for example, *.example.com. Note the following:   The * must replace the entire label. For example, you can't specify *prod.example.com or prod*.example.com.   The * can't replace any of the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com.   If you include * in any position other than the leftmost label in a domain name, DNS treats it as an * character (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard.  You can't use the * wildcard for resource records sets that have a type of NS.    You can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a domain name, for example, *.example.com. You can't use an * for one of the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com. In addition, the * must replace the entire label; for example, you can't specify prod*.example.com.

Creating latency and latency alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not supported.

All values are supported except NS and SOA.  If you're creating an alias record that has the same name as the hosted zone (known as the zone apex), you can't route traffic to a record for which the value of Type is CNAME.

Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to the total. Note the following:   You must specify a value for the Weight element for every weighted resource record set.   You can only specify one ResourceRecord per weighted resource record set.   You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements as weighted resource record sets.   You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements.

The effect of setting Weight to 0 is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets.

Calculated health checks: Route 53 stops aggregating the status of the referenced health checks.    Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms: Route 53 stops monitoring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.   After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status of the health check to always be healthy. If you configured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change the value of UpdateHealthCheckRequest$Inverted. Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is disabled. For more information, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing.

Some endpoints require that HTTPS requests include the host name in the client_hello message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be SSL alert handshake_failure. A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid. The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the Common Name field and possibly several more in the Subject Alternative Names field. One of the domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName. If the endpoint responds to the client_hello message with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in FullyQualifiedDomainName, a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit FullyQualifiedDomainName from the client_hello message.

If you don't specify a value for FailureThreshold, the default value is three health checks.
        public let failureThreshold: Int32?
        /// Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for IPAddress.  If a health check already has a value for IPAddress, you can change the value. However, you can't update an existing health check to add or remove the value of IPAddress.    If you specify a value for IPAddress: Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform health checks. When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:   If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type, Route 53 passes  FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port  to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the above cases.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress: If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IPv4 address that is returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName, the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.  If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).  In this configuration, if the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.  In addition, if the value of Type is HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for IPAddress. If the value of Type is TCP, Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.
        public let fullyQualifiedDomainName: String?
        /// The ID for the health check for which you want detailed information. When you created the health check, CreateHealthCheck returned the ID in the response, in the HealthCheckId element.
        public let healthCheckId: String
        /// A sequential counter that Amazon Route 53 sets to 1 when you create a health check and increments by 1 each time you update settings for the health check. We recommend that you use GetHealthCheck or ListHealthChecks to get the current value of HealthCheckVersion for the health check that you want to update, and that you include that value in your UpdateHealthCheck request. This prevents Route 53 from overwriting an intervening update:   If the value in the UpdateHealthCheck request matches the value of HealthCheckVersion in the health check, Route 53 updates the health check with the new settings.   If the value of HealthCheckVersion in the health check is greater, the health check was changed after you got the version number. Route 53 does not update the health check, and it returns a HealthCheckVersionMismatch error.  
        public let healthCheckVersion: Int64?

To specify the child health checks that you want to associate with a CALCULATED health check, use the ChildHealthChecks and ChildHealthCheck elements. Note the following:   If you specify a number greater than the number of child health checks, Route 53 always considers this health check to be unhealthy.   If you specify 0, Route 53 always considers this health check to be healthy.  
        public let healthThreshold: Int32?
        /// The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address for the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks on. If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IP address that is returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress:     IPv4 address: four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44.    IPv6 address: eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345.   If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for IPAddress. This ensures that the IP address of your instance never changes. For more information, see the applicable documentation:   Linux: Elastic IP Addresses (EIP) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances    Windows: Elastic IP Addresses (EIP) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances     If a health check already has a value for IPAddress, you can change the value. However, you can't update an existing health check to add or remove the value of IPAddress.   For more information, see UpdateHealthCheckRequest$FullyQualifiedDomainName. Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:    RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses     RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space     RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses
