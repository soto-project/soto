AWS OpsWorks Stacks provides a standard set of built-in security groups, one for each layer, which are associated with layers by default. With UseOpsworksSecurityGroups you can instead provide your own custom security groups. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups has the following settings:    True - AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically associates the appropriate built-in security group with each layer (default setting). You can associate additional security groups with a layer after you create it but you cannot delete the built-in security group.   False - AWS OpsWorks Stacks does not associate built-in security groups with layers. You must create appropriate Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) security groups and associate a security group with each layer that you create. However, you can still manually associate a built-in security group with a layer on creation; custom security groups are required only for those layers that need custom settings.

If the VPC ID corresponds to a default VPC and you have specified either the DefaultAvailabilityZone or the DefaultSubnetId parameter only, AWS OpsWorks Stacks infers the value of the other parameter. If you specify neither parameter, AWS OpsWorks Stacks sets these parameters to the first valid Availability Zone for the specified region and the corresponding default VPC subnet ID, respectively.  If you specify a nondefault VPC ID, note the following:   It must belong to a VPC in your account that is in the specified region.   You must specify a value for DefaultSubnetId.

If the --stack-region parameter is not set, but the AWS CLI --region parameter is, this also results in a stack with a regional endpoint. However, if the --region parameter is set to us-east-1, and the --stack-region parameter is set to one of the following, then the stack uses a legacy or classic region: us-west-1, us-west-2, sa-east-1, eu-central-1, eu-west-1, ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2. In this case, the actual API endpoint of the stack is in us-east-1. Only the preceding regions are supported as classic regions in the us-east-1 API endpoint. Because it is a best practice to choose the regional endpoint that is closest to where you manage AWS, we recommend that you use regional endpoints for new stacks.

You can associate additional security groups with a layer after you create it, but you cannot delete the built-in security group.   False - AWS OpsWorks Stacks does not associate built-in security groups with layers. You must create appropriate EC2 security groups and associate a security group with each layer that you create.

If you specify neither parameter, AWS OpsWorks Stacks sets these parameters to the first valid Availability Zone for the specified region and the corresponding default VPC subnet ID, respectively. If you specify a nondefault VPC ID, note the following:   It must belong to a VPC in your account that is in the specified region.   You must specify a value for DefaultSubnetId.

You must also set the allow_reboot argument to true.    allow_reboot - Specifies whether to allow AWS OpsWorks Stacks to reboot the instances if necessary, after installing the updates. This argument can be set to either true or false. The default value is false.

The update_dependencies and install_dependencies commands are supported only for Linux instances. You can run the commands successfully on Windows instances, but they do nothing.

When you update an app, AWS OpsWorks Stacks stores the previous version, up to a maximum of five versions.
