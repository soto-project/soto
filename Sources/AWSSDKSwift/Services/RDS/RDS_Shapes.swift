If you are creating a DB cluster with the same AWS account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new DB cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN for the KMS encryption key. If an encryption key is not specified in KmsKeyId:   If ReplicationSourceIdentifier identifies an encrypted source, then Amazon RDS will use the encryption key used to encrypt the source. Otherwise, Amazon RDS will use your default encryption key.    If the StorageEncrypted parameter is true and ReplicationSourceIdentifier is not specified, then Amazon RDS will use your default encryption key.   AWS KMS creates the default encryption key for your AWS account. Your AWS account has a different default encryption key for each AWS Region. If you create a Read Replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another AWS Region, you must set KmsKeyId to a KMS key ID that is valid in the destination AWS Region. This key is used to encrypt the Read Replica in that AWS Region.

The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the CreateDBCluster API action that can be executed in the source AWS Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster to be copied. The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:    KmsKeyId - The AWS KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in the destination AWS Region. This should refer to the same KMS key for both the CreateDBCluster action that is called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL.    DestinationRegion - The name of the AWS Region that Aurora Read Replica will be created in.    ReplicationSourceIdentifier - The DB cluster identifier for the encrypted DB cluster to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster from the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your ReplicationSourceIdentifier would look like Example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1.

This AWS Region is the same one where the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica action is called that contains this presigned URL.  For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 AWS Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 AWS Region, then you call the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica action in the us-east-1 AWS Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica action in the us-west-2 AWS Region.

For example, you might specify arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805.  If you are copying from a shared manual DB snapshot, this parameter must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB snapshot.  If you are copying an encrypted snapshot this parameter must be in the ARN format for the source AWS Region, and must match the SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier in the PreSignedUrl parameter.

If you don't specify a value for this parameter, then the copy of the DB snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB snapshot.  If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot that is shared from another AWS account, then you must specify a value for this parameter.  If you specify this parameter when you copy an unencrypted snapshot, the copy is encrypted.  If you copy an encrypted snapshot to a different AWS Region, then you must specify a KMS key for the destination AWS Region.

You must specify this parameter when you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from another AWS Region by using the Amazon RDS API. You can specify the --source-region option instead of this parameter when you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from another AWS Region by using the AWS CLI.  The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBSnapshot API action that can be executed in the source AWS Region that contains the encrypted DB snapshot to be copied. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:     DestinationRegion - The AWS Region that the encrypted DB snapshot is copied to. This AWS Region is the same one where the CopyDBSnapshot action is called that contains this presigned URL.  For example, if you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from the us-west-2 AWS Region to the us-east-1 AWS Region, then you call the CopyDBSnapshot action in the us-east-1 AWS Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the CopyDBSnapshot action in the us-west-2 AWS Region. For this example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 AWS Region.     KmsKeyId - The AWS KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB snapshot in the destination AWS Region. This is the same identifier for both the CopyDBSnapshot action that is called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the presigned URL.     SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier - The DB snapshot identifier for the encrypted snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB snapshot from the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20161115.

The PreSignedUrl parameter must be used when copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another AWS Region. The pre-signed URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBSClusterSnapshot API action that can be executed in the source AWS Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter values:    KmsKeyId - The AWS KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region. This is the same identifier for both the CopyDBClusterSnapshot action that is called in the destination AWS Region, and the action contained in the pre-signed URL.

SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source AWS Region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 AWS Region, then your SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115.

If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot that is shared from another AWS account, then you must specify a value for KmsKeyId.  To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot to another AWS Region, you must set KmsKeyId to the KMS key ID you want to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination AWS Region.
