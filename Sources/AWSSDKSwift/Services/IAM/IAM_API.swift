/**
AWS Identity and Access Management AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that you can use to manage users and user permissions under your AWS account. This guide provides descriptions of IAM actions that you can call programmatically. For general information about IAM, see AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). For the user guide for IAM, see Using IAM.   AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM and AWS. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as cryptographically signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see the Tools for Amazon Web Services page.   We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to IAM. However, you can also use the IAM Query API to make direct calls to the IAM web service. To learn more about the IAM Query API, see Making Query Requests in the Using IAM guide. IAM supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.   Signing Requests  Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account access key ID and secret access key for everyday work with IAM. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests. To sign requests, we recommend that you use Signature Version 4. If you have an existing application that uses Signature Version 2, you do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some operations now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations that require version 4 indicate this requirement.   Additional Resources  For more information, see the following:    AWS Security Credentials. This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used for accessing AWS.     IAM Best Practices. This topic presents a list of suggestions for using the IAM service to help secure your AWS resources.     Signing AWS API Requests. This set of topics walk you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and secret access key.

You can use your long-term IAM user or root user credentials, or temporary credentials from assuming an IAM role. SCPs must be enabled for your organization root. You must have the required IAM and AWS Organizations permissions. For more information, see Refining Permissions Using Service Last Accessed Data in the IAM User Guide. You can generate a service last accessed data report for entities by specifying only the entity's path. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by any service control policies (SCPs) that apply to the entity. You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by specifying an entity's path and an optional AWS Organizations policy ID. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service in both report types, the data includes the most recent account activity that the policy allows to account principals in the entity or the entity's children. For important information about the data, reporting period, permissions required, troubleshooting, and supported Regions see Reducing Permissions Using Service Last Accessed Data in the IAM User Guide.  The data includes all attempts to access AWS, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the AWS Management Console, the AWS API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that an account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied.

For more information, see Logging IAM Events with CloudTrail in the IAM User Guide.  This operation returns a JobId. Use this parameter in the  GetOrganizationsAccessReport  operation to check the status of the report generation. To check the status of this request, use the JobId parameter in the  GetOrganizationsAccessReport  operation and test the JobStatus response parameter. When the job is complete, you can retrieve the report. To generate a service last accessed data report for entities, specify an entity path without specifying the optional AWS Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned in the report.    Root – When you specify the organizations root as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to your root. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization except the master account, because the master account is not limited by SCPs.    OU – When you specify an organizational unit (OU) as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the OU and its parents. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children. This data excludes the master account, because the master account is not limited by SCPs.    Master account – When you specify the master account, the resulting report lists all AWS services, because the master account is not limited by SCPs. For each service, the report includes data for only the master account.    Account – When you specify another account as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the account and its parents. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified account.   To generate a service last accessed data report for policies, specify an entity path and the optional AWS Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned for each service.    Root – When you specify the root entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization to which the SCP applies. This data excludes the master account, because the master account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to any entities in the organization, then the report will return a list of services with no data.    OU – When you specify an OU entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children to which the SCP applies. This means that other accounts outside the OU that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. This data excludes the master account, because the master account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to the OU or one of its children, the report will return a list of services with no data.    Master account – When you specify the master account, the resulting report lists all AWS services, because the master account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a policy ID in the CLI or API, the policy is ignored. For each service, the report includes data for only the master account.    Account – When you specify another account entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified account. This means that other accounts in the organization that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. If the SCP is not attached to the account, the report will return a list of services with no data.    Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a principal could access a service. These other policy types include identity-based policies, resource-based policies, access control lists, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies SCP logic.

Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider's certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate does change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.  Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider's certificate and is validated by the thumbprint.
