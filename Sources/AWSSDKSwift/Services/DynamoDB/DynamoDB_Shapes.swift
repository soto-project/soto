        ]
        /// Specifies how to perform the update. Valid values are PUT (default), DELETE, and ADD. The behavior depends on whether the specified primary key already exists in the table.  If an item with the specified Key is found in the table:     PUT - Adds the specified attribute to the item. If the attribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value.     DELETE - If no value is specified, the attribute and its value are removed from the item. The data type of the specified value must match the existing value's data type. If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set [a,b,c] and the DELETE action specified [a,c], then the final attribute value would be [b]. Specifying an empty set is an error.    ADD - If the attribute does not already exist, then the attribute and its values are added to the item. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ADD depends on the data type of the attribute:   If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value is also a number, then the Value is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If Value is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.   If you use ADD to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value. In addition, if you use ADD to update an existing item, and intend to increment or decrement an attribute value which does not yet exist, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update does not yet have an attribute named itemcount, but you decide to ADD the number 3 to this attribute anyway, even though it currently does not exist. DynamoDB will create the itemcount attribute, set its initial value to 0, and finally add 3 to it. The result will be a new itemcount attribute in the item, with a value of 3.    If the existing data type is a set, and if the Value is also a set, then the Value is added to the existing set. (This is a set operation, not mathematical addition.) For example, if the attribute value was the set [1,2], and the ADD action specified [3], then the final attribute value would be [1,2,3]. An error occurs if an Add action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type.  Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the Value must also be a set of strings. The same holds true for number sets and binary sets.   This action is only valid for an existing attribute whose data type is number or is a set. Do not use ADD for any other data types.    If no item with the specified Key is found:     PUT - DynamoDB creates a new item with the specified primary key, and then adds the attribute.     DELETE - Nothing happens; there is no attribute to delete.    ADD - DynamoDB creates an item with the supplied primary key and number (or set of numbers) for the attribute value. The only data types allowed are number and number set; no other data types can be specified.

ExpressionAttributeNames - One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in the ProjectionExpression parameter. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:    {"#P":"Percentile"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more information on expression attribute names, see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.    Keys - An array of primary key attribute values that define specific items in the table. For each primary key, you must provide all of the key attributes. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide the partition key value. For a composite key, you must provide both the partition key value and the sort key value.    ProjectionExpression - A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the table. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be separated by commas. If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they will not appear in the result. For more information, see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.    AttributesToGet - This is a legacy parameter. Use ProjectionExpression instead. For more information, see AttributesToGet in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}.     GE : Greater than or equal.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}.     GT : Greater than.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}.     NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps.  This operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of attribute "a" is null, and you evaluate it using NOT_NULL, the result is a Boolean true. This result is because the attribute "a" exists; its data type is not relevant to the NOT_NULL comparison operator.     NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps.  This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of attribute "a" is null, and you evaluate it using NULL, the result is a Boolean false. This is because the attribute "a" exists; its data type is not relevant to the NULL comparison operator.     CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.  AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set ("SS", "NS", or "BS"), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "a CONTAINS b", "a" can be a list; however, "b" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.    NOT_CONTAINS : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set.  AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set ("SS", "NS", or "BS"), then the operator evaluates to true if it does not find an exact match with any member of the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "a NOT CONTAINS b", "a" can be a list; however, "b" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.    BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type).     IN : Checks for matching elements in a list.  AttributeValueList can contain one or more AttributeValue elements of type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes are compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any elements of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.    BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value.   AttributeValueList must contain two AttributeValue elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not compare to {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}    For usage examples of AttributeValueList and ComparisonOperator, see Legacy Conditional Parameters in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc. The following comparison operators are available:  EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN  The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.    EQ : Equal. EQ is supported for all data types, including lists and maps.  AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}.     NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, including lists and maps.  AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String, Number, Binary, String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an AttributeValue of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}.     LE : Less than or equal.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}.     LT : Less than.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}.     GE : Greater than or equal.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}.     GT : Greater than.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}.     NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps.  This operator tests for the existence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of attribute "a" is null, and you evaluate it using NOT_NULL, the result is a Boolean true. This result is because the attribute "a" exists; its data type is not relevant to the NOT_NULL comparison operator.     NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported for all data types, including lists and maps.  This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute, not its data type. If the data type of attribute "a" is null, and you evaluate it using NULL, the result is a Boolean false. This is because the attribute "a" exists; its data type is not relevant to the NULL comparison operator.     CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or value in a set.  AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the comparison is of type String, then the operator checks for a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set ("SS", "NS", or "BS"), then the operator evaluates to true if it finds an exact match with any member of the set. CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "a CONTAINS b", "a" can be a list; however, "b" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.    NOT_CONTAINS : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or absence of a value in a set.  AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If the target attribute of the comparison is a String, then the operator checks for the absence of a substring match. If the target attribute of the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the input. If the target attribute of the comparison is a set ("SS", "NS", or "BS"), then the operator evaluates to true if it does not find an exact match with any member of the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluating "a NOT CONTAINS b", "a" can be a list; however, "b" cannot be a set, a map, or a list.    BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix.   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute of the comparison must be of type String or Binary (not a Number or a set type).     IN : Checks for matching elements in a list.  AttributeValueList can contain one or more AttributeValue elements of type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes are compared against an existing attribute of an item. If any elements of the input are equal to the item attribute, the expression evaluates to true.    BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to the first value, and less than or equal to the second value.   AttributeValueList must contain two AttributeValue elements of the same type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A target attribute matches if the target value is greater than, or equal to, the first element and less than, or equal to, the second element. If an item contains an AttributeValue element of a different type than the one provided in the request, the value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not compare to {"N":"6"}. Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}

If Exists is false, DynamoDB assumes that the attribute value does not exist in the table. If in fact the value does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the operation succeeds.

This allows Query to retrieve one item with a given partition key value and sort key value, or several items that have the same partition key value but different sort key values. The partition key equality test is required, and must be specified in the following format:  partitionKeyName = :partitionkeyval  If you also want to provide a condition for the sort key, it must be combined using AND with the condition for the sort key. Following is an example, using the = comparison operator for the sort key:  partitionKeyName = :partitionkeyval AND sortKeyName = :sortkeyval  Valid comparisons for the sort key condition are as follows:    sortKeyName = :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is equal to :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName &lt; :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less than :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName &lt;= :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less than or equal to :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName &gt; :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName &gt;=  :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName BETWEEN :sortkeyval1 AND :sortkeyval2 - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval1, and less than or equal to :sortkeyval2.    begins_with ( sortKeyName, :sortkeyval ) - true if the sort key value begins with a particular operand. (You cannot use this function with a sort key that is of type Number.) Note that the function name begins_with is case-sensitive.   Use the ExpressionAttributeValues parameter to replace tokens such as :partitionval and :sortval with actual values at runtime. You can optionally use the ExpressionAttributeNames parameter to replace the names of the partition key and sort key with placeholder tokens. This option might be necessary if an attribute name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word. For example, the following KeyConditionExpression parameter causes an error because Size is a reserved word:    Size = :myval    To work around this, define a placeholder (such a #S) to represent the attribute name Size. KeyConditionExpression then is as follows:    #S = :myval    For a list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

If you query a local secondary index, then for each matching item in the index DynamoDB will fetch the entire item from the parent table. If the index is configured to project all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required.    ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES - Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index. If the index is configured to project all attributes, this return value is equivalent to specifying ALL_ATTRIBUTES.    COUNT - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves.    SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES - Returns only the attributes listed in AttributesToGet. This return value is equivalent to specifying AttributesToGet without specifying any value for Select. If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation will read only the index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB will fetch each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency. If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent table.   If neither Select nor AttributesToGet are specified, DynamoDB defaults to ALL_ATTRIBUTES when accessing a table, and ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES when accessing an index. You cannot use both Select and AttributesToGet together in a single request, unless the value for Select is SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. (This usage is equivalent to specifying AttributesToGet without any value for Select.)  If you use the ProjectionExpression parameter, then the value for Select can only be SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES.

(For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:    {"#P":"Percentile"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

You can retrieve all item attributes, specific item attributes, the count of matching items, or in the case of an index, some or all of the attributes projected into the index.    ALL_ATTRIBUTES - Returns all of the item attributes from the specified table or index. If you query a local secondary index, then for each matching item in the index DynamoDB will fetch the entire item from the parent table. If the index is configured to project all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required.    ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES - Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index. If the index is configured to project all attributes, this return value is equivalent to specifying ALL_ATTRIBUTES.    COUNT - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves.    SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES - Returns only the attributes listed in AttributesToGet. This return value is equivalent to specifying AttributesToGet without specifying any value for Select. If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation will read only the index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB will fetch each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency. If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent table.   If neither Select nor AttributesToGet are specified, DynamoDB defaults to ALL_ATTRIBUTES when accessing a table, and ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES when accessing an index. You cannot use both Select and AttributesToGet together in a single request, unless the value for Select is SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. (This usage is equivalent to specifying AttributesToGet without any value for Select.)  If you use the ProjectionExpression parameter, then the value for Select can only be SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES.

The following action values are available for UpdateExpression.    SET - Adds one or more attributes and values to an item. If any of these attribute already exist, they are replaced by the new values. You can also use SET to add or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example: SET myNum = myNum + :val   SET supports the following functions:    if_not_exists (path, operand) - if the item does not contain an attribute at the specified path, then if_not_exists evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in the item.    list_append (operand, operand) - evaluates to a list with a new element added to it. You can append the new element to the start or the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands.   These function names are case-sensitive.    REMOVE - Removes one or more attributes from an item.    ADD - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ADD depends on the data type of the attribute:   If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value is also a number, then Value is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If Value is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.  If you use ADD to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value. Similarly, if you use ADD for an existing item to increment or decrement an attribute value that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update doesn't have an attribute named itemcount, but you decide to ADD the number 3 to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the itemcount attribute, set its initial value to 0, and finally add 3 to it. The result will be a new itemcount attribute in the item, with a value of 3.    If the existing data type is a set and if Value is also a set, then Value is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set [1,2], and the ADD action specified [3], then the final attribute value is [1,2,3]. An error occurs if an ADD action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type.  Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the Value must also be a set of strings.    The ADD action only supports Number and set data types. In addition, ADD can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes.     DELETE - Deletes an element from a set. If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set [a,b,c] and the DELETE action specifies [a,c], then the final attribute value is [b]. Specifying an empty set is an error.  The DELETE action only supports set data types. In addition, DELETE can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes.
