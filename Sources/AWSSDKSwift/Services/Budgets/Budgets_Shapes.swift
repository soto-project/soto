If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose DAILY, and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC. If you chose MONTHLY, AWS set your start date to 01/01/18 00:00 UTC. If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC.
