For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of PlannedBudgetLimits values. This must start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The key is the start of the month, UTC in epoch seconds.  For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of PlannedBudgetLimits value entries in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter and include the next 3 quarters. The key is the start of the quarter, UTC in epoch seconds.  If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for quarterly, provide the PlannedBudgetLimits values only for the remaining periods. If the budget begins at a date in the future, provide PlannedBudgetLimits values from the start date of the budget.  After all of the BudgetLimit values in PlannedBudgetLimits are used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the BudgetLimit. At that point, the planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.   DescribeBudget and DescribeBudgets response along with PlannedBudgetLimits will also contain BudgetLimit representing the current month or quarter limit present in PlannedBudgetLimits. This only applies to budgets created with PlannedBudgetLimits. Budgets created without PlannedBudgetLimits will only contain BudgetLimit, and no PlannedBudgetLimits.

The end date must come before 06/15/87 00:00 UTC.  If you create your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose DAILY, and didn't set a start date, AWS set your start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC. If you chose MONTHLY, AWS set your start date to 01/01/18 00:00 UTC. If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC. The defaults are the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and the API.  You can change either date with the UpdateBudget operation. After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated notifications and subscribers.
