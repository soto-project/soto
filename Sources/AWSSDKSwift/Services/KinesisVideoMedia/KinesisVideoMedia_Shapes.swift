AWS_KINESISVIDEO_MILLIS_BEHIND_NOW (UTF-8 string) - Client applications can use this tag value to determine how far behind the chunk returned in the response is from the latest chunk on the stream.    AWS_KINESISVIDEO_FRAGMENT_NUMBER - Fragment number returned in the chunk.   AWS_KINESISVIDEO_SERVER_TIMESTAMP - Server time stamp of the fragment.   AWS_KINESISVIDEO_PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP - Producer time stamp of the fragment.   The following tags will be present if an error occurs:   AWS_KINESISVIDEO_ERROR_CODE - String description of an error that caused GetMedia to stop.   AWS_KINESISVIDEO_ERROR_ID: Integer code of the error.   The error codes are as follows:   3002 - Error writing to the stream   4000 - Requested fragment is not found   4500 - Access denied for the stream's KMS key   4501 - Stream's KMS key is disabled   4502 - Validation error on the Stream's KMS key   4503 - KMS key specified in the stream is unavailable   4504 - Invalid usage of the KMS key specified in the stream   4505 - Invalid state of the KMS key specified in the stream   4506 - Unable to find the KMS key specified in the stream   5000 - Internal error
