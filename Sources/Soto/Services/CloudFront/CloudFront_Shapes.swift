If you don’t want to require signed URLs in requests for objects that match PathPattern, specify false for Enabled and 0 for Quantity. Omit Items.

The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.     https-only: If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).    For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.  The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously. For more information, see Managing Cache Expiration in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.

If you substitute 200, the response typically won't be intercepted.   If you don't care about distinguishing among different client errors or server errors, you can specify 400 or 500 as the ResponseCode for all 4xx or 5xx errors.   You might want to return a 200 status code (OK) and static website so your customers don't know that your website is down.

For example, suppose you saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon S3 bucket in a directory named /4xx-errors. Your distribution must include a cache behavior for which the path pattern routes requests for your custom error pages to that location, for example, /4xx-errors/*.    The value of TargetOriginId specifies the value of the ID element for the origin that contains your custom error pages.   If you specify a value for ResponsePagePath, you must also specify a value for ResponseCode. We recommend that you store custom error pages in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error pages on an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want to return to viewers because the origin server is unavailable.

The viewer then resubmits the request using the new URL.    https-only: If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).   For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol, see Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.  The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object that was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to fetch the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects’ cache because cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means that an edge location will return an object from the cache regardless of whether the current request protocol matches the protocol used previously.
