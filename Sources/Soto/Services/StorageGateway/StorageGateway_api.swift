/// Service object for interacting with AWS StorageGateway service.

/// Storage Gateway Service  Amazon FSx File Gateway is no longer available to new customers. Existing customers of FSx File Gateway can continue to use the service normally. For capabilities similar to FSx File Gateway, visit this blog post.  Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an organization's on-premises IT environment and the Amazon Web Services storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery. Use the following links to get started using the Storage Gateway Service API Reference:    Storage Gateway required request headers: Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST request to Storage Gateway.    Signing requests: Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you send; this topic describes how sign such a request.    Error responses: Provides reference information about Storage Gateway errors.    Operations in Storage Gateway: Contains detailed descriptions of all Storage Gateway operations, their request parameters, response elements, possible errors, and examples of requests and responses.    Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas: Provides a list of each Amazon Web Services Region and the endpoints available for use with Storage Gateway.    Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might be vol-AA22BB012345DAF670. When you use this ID with the EC2 API, you must change it to vol-aa22bb012345daf670. Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as expected.   IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting in April 2016, you will be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your systems with the new format. For more information, see Longer EC2 and EBS resource IDs. For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID format looks like the following:  arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG. A snapshot ID with the longer ID format looks like the following: snap-78e226633445566ee. For more information, see Announcement: Heads-up – Longer Storage Gateway volume and snapshot IDs coming in 2016.

SettlingTimeInSeconds controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.   SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification. This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which the notification will be sent.

    /// Creates a Server Message Block (SMB) file share on an existing S3 File Gateway. In Storage Gateway, a file share is a file system mount point backed by Amazon S3 cloud storage. Storage Gateway exposes file shares using an SMB interface. This operation is only supported for S3 File Gateways.  S3 File Gateways require Security Token Service (Amazon Web Services STS) to be activated to enable you to create a file share. Make sure that Amazon Web Services STS is activated in the Amazon Web Services Region you are creating your S3 File Gateway in. If Amazon Web Services STS is not activated in this Amazon Web Services Region, activate it. For information about how to activate Amazon Web Services STS, see Activating and deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an Amazon Web Services Region in the Identity and Access Management User Guide. File gateways don't support creating hard or symbolic links on a file share.
    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - accessBasedEnumeration: The files and folders on this share will only be visible to users with read access.
    ///   - adminUserList: A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that will be granted administrator privileges on the file share. These users can do all file operations as the super-user. Acceptable formats include: DOMAIN\User1, user1, @group1, and @DOMAIN\group1.  Use this option very carefully, because any user in this list can do anything they like on the file share, regardless of file permissions.
    ///   - auditDestinationARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for audit logs.
    ///   - authentication: The authentication method that users use to access the file share. The default is ActiveDirectory. Valid Values: ActiveDirectory | GuestAccess
    ///   - bucketRegion: Specifies the Region of the S3 bucket where the SMB file share stores files.  This parameter is required for SMB file shares that connect to Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an access point alias that points to a VPC access point.
    ///   - cacheAttributes: Specifies refresh cache information for the file share.
    ///   - caseSensitivity: The case of an object name in an Amazon S3 bucket. For ClientSpecified, the client determines the case sensitivity. For CaseSensitive, the gateway determines the case sensitivity. The default value is ClientSpecified.
    ///   - clientToken: A unique string value that you supply that is used by S3 File Gateway to ensure idempotent file share creation.
    ///   - defaultStorageClass: The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon S3 bucket by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is S3_STANDARD. Optional. Valid Values: S3_STANDARD | S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING | S3_STANDARD_IA | S3_ONEZONE_IA
    ///   - encryptionType: A value that specifies the type of server-side encryption that the file share will use for the data that it stores in Amazon S3.  We recommend using EncryptionType instead of KMSEncrypted to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters. If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if EncryptionType is SseS3, then KMSEncrypted must be false. If EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms, then KMSEncrypted must be true.
    ///   - fileShareName: The name of the file share. Optional.   FileShareName must be set if an S3 prefix name is set in LocationARN, or if an access point or access point alias is used. A valid SMB file share name cannot contain the following characters: [,],#,;,,>,:,",\,/,|,?,*,+, or ASCII control characters 1-31.
    ///   - gatewayARN: The ARN of the S3 File Gateway on which you want to create a file share.
    ///   - guessMIMETypeEnabled: A value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded objects based on file extensions. Set this value to true to enable MIME type guessing, otherwise set to false. The default value is true. Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - invalidUserList: A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that are not allowed to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character. Acceptable formats include: DOMAIN\User1, user1, @group1, and @DOMAIN\group1. Can only be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory.
    ///   - kmsKey: Optional. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value must be set if KMSEncrypted is true, or if EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms.
    ///   - locationARN: A custom ARN for the backend storage used for storing data for file shares. It includes a resource ARN with an optional prefix concatenation. The prefix must end with a forward slash (/).  You can specify LocationARN as a bucket ARN, access point ARN or access point alias, as shown in the following examples. Bucket ARN:  arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/prefix/  Access point ARN:  arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/access-point-name/prefix/  If you specify an access point, the bucket policy must be configured to delegate access control to the access point. For information, see Delegating access control to access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Access point alias:  test-ap-ab123cdef4gehijklmn5opqrstuvuse1a-s3alias
    ///   - notificationPolicy: The notification policy of the file share. SettlingTimeInSeconds controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.   SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification. This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which the notification will be sent. In some cases, the gateway might require more than the specified delay time to generate and send notifications.  The following example sets NotificationPolicy on with SettlingTimeInSeconds set to 60.  {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}  The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.  {}
    ///   - objectACL: A value that sets the access control list (ACL) permission for objects in the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts objects into. The default value is private.
    ///   - oplocksEnabled: Specifies whether opportunistic locking is enabled for the SMB file share.  Enabling opportunistic locking on case-sensitive shares is not recommended for workloads that involve access to files with the same name in different case.  Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - readOnly: A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set this value to true to set the write status to read-only, otherwise set to false. Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - requesterPays: A value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost associated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set to true, the requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always pays the cost of storing data.   RequesterPays is a configuration for the S3 bucket that backs the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the file share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.  Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - role: The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that an S3 File Gateway assumes when it accesses the underlying storage.
    ///   - smbaclEnabled: Set this value to true to enable access control list (ACL) on the SMB file share. Set it to false to map file and directory permissions to the POSIX permissions. For more information, see Using Windows ACLs to limit SMB file share access in the Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide. Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - tags: A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to the NFS file share. Each tag is a key-value pair.  Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a tag's key is 128 characters, and the maximum length for a tag's value is 256.
    ///   - validUserList: A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that are allowed to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character. Acceptable formats include: DOMAIN\User1, user1, @group1, and @DOMAIN\group1. Can only be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory.
    ///   - vpcEndpointDNSName: Specifies the DNS name for the VPC endpoint that the SMB file share uses to connect to Amazon S3.  This parameter is required for SMB file shares that connect to Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an access point alias that points to a VPC access point.

After a successful request, the cache clean operation occurs asynchronously and reports progress using CloudWatch logs and notifications.  If ForceRemove is set to True, the cache clean operation will delete file data from the gateway which might otherwise be recoverable. We recommend using this operation only after all other methods to clear files failing upload have been exhausted, and if your business need outweighs the potential data loss.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - fileShareARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share for which you want to start the cache clean operation.

Valid arguments:    False - The cache clean operation skips cache entries failing upload if they are associated with data currently stored on the gateway. This preserves the cached data.    True - The cache clean operation removes cache entries failing upload even if they are associated with data currently stored on the gateway. This deletes the cached data.

This API action cannot be used to shut down S3 File Gateway or FSx File Gateway.  The operation shuts down the gateway service component running in the gateway's virtual machine (VM) and not the host VM.  If you want to shut down the VM, it is recommended that you first shut down the gateway component in the VM to avoid unpredictable conditions.  After the gateway is shutdown, you cannot call any other API except StartGateway, DescribeGatewayInformation, and ListGateways. For more information, see ActivateGateway. Your applications cannot read from or write to the gateway's storage volumes, and there are no snapshots taken.  When you make a shutdown request, you will get a 200 OK success response immediately. However, it might take some time for the gateway to shut down. You can call the DescribeGatewayInformation API to check the status. For more information, see ActivateGateway.  If do not intend to use the gateway again, you must delete the gateway (using DeleteGateway) to no longer pay software charges associated with the gateway.
