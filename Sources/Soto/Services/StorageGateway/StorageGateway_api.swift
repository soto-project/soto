/// Service object for interacting with AWS StorageGateway service.
///
/// Storage Gateway Service Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an organization's on-premises IT environment and the Amazon Web Services storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery. Use the following links to get started using the Storage Gateway Service API Reference:    Storage Gateway required request headers: Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST request to Storage Gateway.    Signing requests: Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you send; this topic describes how sign such a request.    Error responses: Provides reference information about Storage Gateway errors.    Operations in Storage Gateway: Contains detailed descriptions of all Storage Gateway operations, their request parameters, response elements, possible errors, and examples of requests and responses.    Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas: Provides a list of each Amazon Web Services Region and the endpoints available for use with Storage Gateway.    Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might be vol-AA22BB012345DAF670. When you use this ID with the EC2 API, you must change it to vol-aa22bb012345daf670. Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as expected.   IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting in April 2016, you will be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your systems with the new format. For more information, see Longer EC2 and EBS resource IDs. For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID format looks like the following:  arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG. A snapshot ID with the longer ID format looks like the following: snap-78e226633445566ee. For more information, see Announcement: Heads-up – Longer Storage Gateway volume and snapshot IDs coming in 2016.

    ///   - encryptionType: A value that specifies the type of server-side encryption that the file share will use for the data that it stores in Amazon S3.  We recommend using EncryptionType instead of KMSEncrypted to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters. If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if EncryptionType is SseS3, then KMSEncrypted must be false. If EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms, then KMSEncrypted must be true.

    ///   - notificationPolicy: The notification policy of the file share. SettlingTimeInSeconds controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.   SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification. This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which the notification will be sent. In some cases, the gateway might require more than the specified delay time to generate and send notifications.  The following example sets NotificationPolicy on with SettlingTimeInSeconds set to 60.  {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}  The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.  {}

    ///   - requesterPays: A value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost associated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set to true, the requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always pays the cost of storing data.   RequesterPays is a configuration for the S3 bucket that backs the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the file share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

    ///   - cacheAttributes: Specifies refresh cache information for the file share.
    ///   - caseSensitivity: The case of an object name in an Amazon S3 bucket. For ClientSpecified, the client determines the case sensitivity. For CaseSensitive, the gateway determines the case sensitivity. The default value is ClientSpecified.
    ///   - clientToken: A unique string value that you supply that is used by S3 File Gateway to ensure idempotent file share creation.
    ///   - defaultStorageClass: The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon S3 bucket by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is S3_STANDARD. Optional. Valid Values: S3_STANDARD | S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING | S3_STANDARD_IA | S3_ONEZONE_IA
    ///   - encryptionType: A value that specifies the type of server-side encryption that the file share will use for the data that it stores in Amazon S3.  We recommend using EncryptionType instead of KMSEncrypted to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters. If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if EncryptionType is SseS3, then KMSEncrypted must be false. If EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms, then KMSEncrypted must be true.
    ///   - fileShareName: The name of the file share. Optional.   FileShareName must be set if an S3 prefix name is set in LocationARN, or if an access point or access point alias is used.
    ///   - gatewayARN: The ARN of the S3 File Gateway on which you want to create a file share.
    ///   - guessMIMETypeEnabled: A value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded objects based on file extensions. Set this value to true to enable MIME type guessing, otherwise set to false. The default value is true. Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - invalidUserList: A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that are not allowed to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character. Acceptable formats include: DOMAIN\User1, user1, @group1, and @DOMAIN\group1. Can only be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory.
    ///   - kmsKey: Optional. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value must be set if KMSEncrypted is true, or if EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms.
    ///   - locationARN: A custom ARN for the backend storage used for storing data for file shares. It includes a resource ARN with an optional prefix concatenation. The prefix must end with a forward slash (/).  You can specify LocationARN as a bucket ARN, access point ARN or access point alias, as shown in the following examples. Bucket ARN:  arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/prefix/  Access point ARN:  arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/access-point-name/prefix/  If you specify an access point, the bucket policy must be configured to delegate access control to the access point. For information, see Delegating access control to access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Access point alias:  test-ap-ab123cdef4gehijklmn5opqrstuvuse1a-s3alias
    ///   - notificationPolicy: The notification policy of the file share. SettlingTimeInSeconds controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.   SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification. This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which the notification will be sent. In some cases, the gateway might require more than the specified delay time to generate and send notifications.  The following example sets NotificationPolicy on with SettlingTimeInSeconds set to 60.  {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}  The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.  {}
    ///   - objectACL: A value that sets the access control list (ACL) permission for objects in the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts objects into. The default value is private.
    ///   - oplocksEnabled: Specifies whether opportunistic locking is enabled for the SMB file share.  Enabling opportunistic locking on case-sensitive shares is not recommended for workloads that involve access to files with the same name in different case.  Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - readOnly: A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set this value to true to set the write status to read-only, otherwise set to false. Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - requesterPays: A value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost associated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set to true, the requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always pays the cost of storing data.   RequesterPays is a configuration for the S3 bucket that backs the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the file share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.  Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - role: The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that an S3 File Gateway assumes when it accesses the underlying storage.
    ///   - smbaclEnabled: Set this value to true to enable access control list (ACL) on the SMB file share. Set it to false to map file and directory permissions to the POSIX permissions. For more information, see Using Windows ACLs to limit SMB file share access in the Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide. Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - tags: A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to the NFS file share. Each tag is a key-value pair.  Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8 format, and the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a tag's key is 128 characters, and the maximum length for a tag's value is 256.
    ///   - validUserList: A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that are allowed to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character. Acceptable formats include: DOMAIN\User1, user1, @group1, and @DOMAIN\group1. Can only be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory.

Throttle limit: This API is asynchronous, so the gateway will accept no more than two refreshes at any time. We recommend using the refresh-complete CloudWatch event notification before issuing additional requests. For more information, see Getting notified about file operations in the Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide.    Wait at least 60 seconds between consecutive RefreshCache API requests.   If you invoke the RefreshCache API when two requests are already being processed, any new request will cause an InvalidGatewayRequestException error because too many requests were sent to the server.     The S3 bucket name does not need to be included when entering the list of folders in the FolderList parameter.  For more information, see Getting notified about file operations in the Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide.
    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - fileShareARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share you want to refresh.
    ///   - folderList: A comma-separated list of the paths of folders to refresh in the cache. The default is ["/"]. The default refreshes objects and folders at the root of the Amazon S3 bucket. If Recursive is set to true, the entire S3 bucket that the file share has access to is refreshed. Do not include / when specifying folder names. For example, you would specify samplefolder rather than samplefolder/.
    ///   - recursive: A value that specifies whether to recursively refresh folders in the cache. The refresh includes folders that were in the cache the last time the gateway listed the folder's contents. If this value set to true, each folder that is listed in FolderList is recursively updated. Otherwise, subfolders listed in FolderList are not refreshed. Only objects that are in folders listed directly under FolderList are found and used for the update. The default is true.

    ///   - adminUserList: A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that have administrator rights to the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character. Acceptable formats include: DOMAIN\User1, user1, @group1, and @DOMAIN\group1. Can only be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory.
    ///   - auditDestinationARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for audit logs.
    ///   - cacheAttributes: Specifies refresh cache information for the file share.
    ///   - caseSensitivity: The case of an object name in an Amazon S3 bucket. For ClientSpecified, the client determines the case sensitivity. For CaseSensitive, the gateway determines the case sensitivity. The default value is ClientSpecified.
    ///   - defaultStorageClass: The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon S3 bucket by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is S3_STANDARD. Optional. Valid Values: S3_STANDARD | S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING | S3_STANDARD_IA | S3_ONEZONE_IA
    ///   - encryptionType: A value that specifies the type of server-side encryption that the file share will use for the data that it stores in Amazon S3.  We recommend using EncryptionType instead of KMSEncrypted to set the file share encryption method. You do not need to provide values for both parameters. If values for both parameters exist in the same request, then the specified encryption methods must not conflict. For example, if EncryptionType is SseS3, then KMSEncrypted must be false. If EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms, then KMSEncrypted must be true.
    ///   - fileShareARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SMB file share that you want to update.
    ///   - fileShareName: The name of the file share. Optional.   FileShareName must be set if an S3 prefix name is set in LocationARN, or if an access point or access point alias is used.
    ///   - guessMIMETypeEnabled: A value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded objects based on file extensions. Set this value to true to enable MIME type guessing, otherwise set to false. The default value is true. Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - invalidUserList: A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that are not allowed to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character. Acceptable formats include: DOMAIN\User1, user1, @group1, and @DOMAIN\group1. Can only be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory.
    ///   - kmsKey: Optional. The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value must be set if KMSEncrypted is true, or if EncryptionType is SseKms or DsseKms.
    ///   - notificationPolicy: The notification policy of the file share. SettlingTimeInSeconds controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.   SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification. This setting is not meant to specify an exact time at which the notification will be sent. In some cases, the gateway might require more than the specified delay time to generate and send notifications.  The following example sets NotificationPolicy on with SettlingTimeInSeconds set to 60.  {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}  The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.  {}
    ///   - objectACL: A value that sets the access control list (ACL) permission for objects in the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts objects into. The default value is private.
    ///   - oplocksEnabled: Specifies whether opportunistic locking is enabled for the SMB file share.  Enabling opportunistic locking on case-sensitive shares is not recommended for workloads that involve access to files with the same name in different case.  Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - readOnly: A value that sets the write status of a file share. Set this value to true to set write status to read-only, otherwise set to false. Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - requesterPays: A value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost associated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set to true, the requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always pays the cost of storing data.   RequesterPays is a configuration for the S3 bucket that backs the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the file share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.  Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - smbaclEnabled: Set this value to true to enable access control list (ACL) on the SMB file share. Set it to false to map file and directory permissions to the POSIX permissions. For more information, see Using Windows ACLs to limit SMB file share access in the Amazon S3 File Gateway User Guide. Valid Values: true | false
    ///   - validUserList: A list of users or groups in the Active Directory that are allowed to access the file share. A group must be prefixed with the @ character. Acceptable formats include: DOMAIN\User1, user1, @group1, and @DOMAIN\group1. Can only be set if Authentication is set to ActiveDirectory.
