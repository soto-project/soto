    /// Analyzes an input document for relationships between detected items.  The types of information returned are as follows:    Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned in two Block objects, each of type KEY_VALUE_SET: a KEY Block object and a VALUE Block object. For example, Name: Ana Silva Carolina contains a key and value. Name: is the key. Ana Silva Carolina is the value.   Table and table cell data. A TABLE Block object contains information about a detected table. A CELL Block object is returned for each cell in a table.   Lines and words of text. A LINE Block object contains one or more WORD Block objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with the value of FeatureTypes).    Signatures. A SIGNATURE Block object contains the location information of a signature in a document. If used in conjunction with forms or tables, a signature can be given a Key-Value pairing or be detected in the cell of a table.   Query. A QUERY Block object contains the query text, alias and link to the associated Query results block object.   Query Result. A QUERY_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the query and an ID that connects it to the query asked. This Block also contains a confidence score.   Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT Block object contains information about a selection element, including the selection status. You can choose which type of analysis to perform by specifying the FeatureTypes list.  The output is returned in a list of Block objects.  AnalyzeDocument is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use StartDocumentAnalysis. For more information, see Document Text Analysis.

StartExpenseAnalysis can analyze text in documents that are in JPEG, PNG, and PDF format. The documents must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use the DocumentLocation parameter to specify the name of your S3 bucket and the name of the document in that bucket.   StartExpenseAnalysis returns a job identifier (JobId) that you will provide to GetExpenseAnalysis to retrieve the results of the operation. When the analysis of the input invoices/receipts is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you provide to the NotificationChannel. To obtain the results of the invoice and receipt analysis operation, ensure that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetExpenseAnalysis, and pass the job identifier (JobId) that was returned by your call to StartExpenseAnalysis. For more information, see Analyzing Invoices and Receipts.

Use DocumentLocation to specify the bucket name and the file name of the document.   StartLendingAnalysis returns a job identifier (JobId) that you use to get the results of the operation. When the text analysis is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you specify in NotificationChannel.

If the status is SUCCEEDED you can call either GetLendingAnalysis or GetLendingAnalysisSummary and provide the JobId to obtain the results of the analysis.
