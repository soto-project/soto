    /// Analyzes an input document for relationships between detected items.  The types of information returned are as follows:    Form data (key-value pairs). The related information is returned in two Block objects, each of type KEY_VALUE_SET: a KEY Block object and a VALUE Block object. For example, Name: Ana Silva Carolina contains a key and value. Name: is the key. Ana Silva Carolina is the value.   Table and table cell data. A TABLE Block object contains information about a detected table. A CELL Block object is returned for each cell in a table.   Lines and words of text. A LINE Block object contains one or more WORD Block objects. All lines and words that are detected in the document are returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship with the value of FeatureTypes).    Signatures. A SIGNATURE Block object contains the location information of a signature in a document. If used in conjunction with forms or tables, a signature can be given a Key-Value pairing or be detected in the cell of a table.   Query. A QUERY Block object contains the query text, alias and link to the associated Query results block object.   Query Result. A QUERY_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the query and an ID that connects it to the query asked. This Block also contains a confidence score.   Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons (radio buttons) can be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT Block object contains information about a selection element, including the selection status. You can choose which type of analysis to perform by specifying the FeatureTypes list.  The output is returned in a list of Block objects.  AnalyzeDocument is a synchronous operation. To analyze documents asynchronously, use StartDocumentAnalysis.

Query. A QUERY Block object contains the query text, alias and link to the associated Query results block object.   Query Results. A QUERY_RESULT Block object contains the answer to the query and an ID that connects it to the query asked. This Block also contains a confidence score.    While processing a document with queries, look out for INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMETERS output. This indicates that either the per page query limit has been exceeded or that the operation is trying to query a page in the document which doesn’t exist.
