Specify a value between 16 and 62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth required to stream a video by reducing the maximum bit rate, but this also reduces the quality of the video.  BufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)  The maximum number of bits in any x seconds of the output video. This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard segment duration when you're using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the container type of the output video. Specify an integer greater than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize, Elastic Transcoder sets BufferSize to 10 times the value of MaxBitRate.  InterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)  The interlace mode for the output video. Interlaced video is used to double the perceived frame rate for a video by interlacing two fields (one field on every other line, the other field on the other lines) so that the human eye registers multiple pictures per frame. Interlacing reduces the bandwidth required for transmitting a video, but can result in blurred images and flickering. Valid values include Progressive (no interlacing, top to bottom), TopFirst (top field first), BottomFirst (bottom field first), and Auto. If InterlaceMode is not specified, Elastic Transcoder uses Progressive for the output. If Auto is specified, Elastic Transcoder interlaces the output.  ColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)  The color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies to the output video. Color spaces are the algorithms used by the computer to store information about how to render color. Bt.601 is the standard for standard definition video, while Bt.709 is the standard for high definition video. Valid values include None, Bt709toBt601, Bt601toBt709, and Auto. If you chose Auto for ColorSpaceConversionMode and your output is interlaced, your frame rate is one of 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97, 50, or 60, your SegmentDuration is null, and you are using one of the resolution changes from the list below, Elastic Transcoder applies the following color space conversions:    Standard to HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709     Standard to HD, 720x576 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709     HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x480 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601     HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x576 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601     Elastic Transcoder may change the behavior of the ColorspaceConversionMode Auto mode in the future. All outputs in a playlist must use the same ColorSpaceConversionMode.  If you do not specify a ColorSpaceConversionMode, Elastic Transcoder does not change the color space of a file. If you are unsure what ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied to your output file, you can check the AppliedColorSpaceConversion parameter included in your job response. If your job does not have an AppliedColorSpaceConversion in its response, no ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied.  ChromaSubsampling  The sampling pattern for the chroma (color) channels of the output video. Valid values include yuv420p and yuv422p.  yuv420p samples the chroma information of every other horizontal and every other vertical line, yuv422p samples the color information of every horizontal line and every other vertical line.  LoopCount (Gif Only)  The number of times you want the output gif to loop. Valid values include Infinite and integers between 0 and 100, inclusive.

        /// Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264, MPEG2, or VP8. Whether to use a fixed value for FixedGOP. Valid values are true and false:    true: Elastic Transcoder uses the value of KeyframesMaxDist for the distance between key frames (the number of frames in a group of pictures, or GOP).    false: The distance between key frames can vary.     FixedGOP must be set to true for fmp4 containers.
        public let fixedGOP: String?
        /// The frames per second for the video stream in the output file. Valid values include:  auto, 10, 15, 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 60  If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder uses the detected frame rate of the input source. If you specify a frame rate, we recommend that you perform the following calculation:  Frame rate = maximum recommended decoding speed in luma samples/second / (width in pixels * height in pixels)  where:    width in pixels and height in pixels represent the Resolution of the output video.    maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second is less than or equal to the maximum value listed in the following table, based on the value that you specified for Level.   The maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second for each level is described in the following list (Level - Decoding speed):   1 - 380160   1b - 380160   1.1 - 76800   1.2 - 1536000   1.3 - 3041280   2 - 3041280   2.1 - 5068800   2.2 - 5184000   3 - 10368000   3.1 - 27648000   3.2 - 55296000   4 - 62914560   4.1 - 62914560
        public let frameRate: String?
        /// Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264, MPEG2, or VP8. The maximum number of frames between key frames. Key frames are fully encoded frames; the frames between key frames are encoded based, in part, on the content of the key frames. The value is an integer formatted as a string; valid values are between 1 (every frame is a key frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher value results in higher compression but may also discernibly decrease video quality. For Smooth outputs, the FrameRate must have a constant ratio to the KeyframesMaxDist. This allows Smooth playlists to switch between different quality levels while the file is being played. For example, an input file can have a FrameRate of 30 with a KeyframesMaxDist of 90. The output file then needs to have a ratio of 1:3. Valid outputs would have FrameRate of 30, 25, and 10, and KeyframesMaxDist of 90, 75, and 30, respectively. Alternately, this can be achieved by setting FrameRate to auto and having the same values for MaxFrameRate and KeyframesMaxDist.
        public let keyframesMaxDist: String?
        /// If you specify auto for FrameRate, Elastic Transcoder uses the frame rate of the input video for the frame rate of the output video.

Valid values include: 10, 15, 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 60.
        public let maxFrameRate: String?
        /// The maximum height of the output video in pixels. If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as the default value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even integer between 96 and 3072.

        ///  The maximum width of the output video in pixels. If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder uses 1920 (Full HD) as the default value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even integer between 128 and 4096.
        public let maxWidth: String?
        /// When you set PaddingPolicy to Pad, Elastic Transcoder may add black bars to the top and bottom and/or left and right sides of the output video to make the total size of the output video match the values that you specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight.
        public let paddingPolicy: String?
        ///  To better control resolution and aspect ratio of output videos, we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth, MaxHeight, SizingPolicy, PaddingPolicy, and DisplayAspectRatio instead of Resolution and AspectRatio. The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together.  The width and height of the video in the output file, in pixels. Valid values are auto and width x height:    auto: Elastic Transcoder attempts to preserve the width and height of the input file, subject to the following rules.     width x height : The width and height of the output video in pixels.   Note the following about specifying the width and height:   The width must be an even integer between 128 and 4096, inclusive.   The height must be an even integer between 96 and 3072, inclusive.   If you specify a resolution that is less than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output file to the lower resolution.   If you specify a resolution that is greater than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output to the higher resolution.   We recommend that you specify a resolution for which the product of width and height is less than or equal to the applicable value in the following list (List - Max width x height value):   1 - 25344   1b - 25344   1.1 - 101376   1.2 - 101376   1.3 - 101376   2 - 101376   2.1 - 202752   2.2 - 404720   3 - 404720   3.1 - 921600   3.2 - 1310720   4 - 2097152   4.1 - 2097152

        /// Specify one of the following values to control scaling of the output video:    Fit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video so it matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight without exceeding the other value.    Fill: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video so it matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight and matches or exceeds the other value. Elastic Transcoder centers the output video and then crops it in the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.    Stretch: Elastic Transcoder stretches the output video to match the values that you specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight. If the relative proportions of the input video and the output video are different, the output video will be distorted.    Keep: Elastic Transcoder does not scale the output video. If either dimension of the input video exceeds the values that you specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight, Elastic Transcoder crops the output video.    ShrinkToFit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video down so that its dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without exceeding either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the video up.    ShrinkToFill: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video down so that its dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without dropping below either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the video up.

        /// Settings for the size, location, and opacity of graphics that you want Elastic Transcoder to overlay over videos that are transcoded using this preset. You can specify settings for up to four watermarks. Watermarks appear in the specified size and location, and with the specified opacity for the duration of the transcoded video. Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to display a watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png format, which supports transparency. When you create a job that uses this preset, you specify the .png or .jpg graphics that you want Elastic Transcoder to include in the transcoded videos. You can specify fewer graphics in the job than you specify watermark settings in the preset, which allows you to use the same preset for up to four watermarks that have different dimensions.
