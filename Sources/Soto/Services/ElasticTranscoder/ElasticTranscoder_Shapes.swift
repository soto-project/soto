You can grant permissions to a maximum of 30 users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups.    GranteeType: Specify the type of value that appears in the Grantee object:     Canonical: The value in the Grantee object is either the canonical user ID for an AWS account or an origin access identity for an Amazon CloudFront distribution.   A canonical user ID is not the same as an AWS account number.     Email: The value in the Grantee object is the registered email address of an AWS account.     Group: The value in the Grantee object is one of the following predefined Amazon S3 groups: AllUsers, AuthenticatedUsers, or LogDelivery.      Grantee: The AWS user or group that you want to have access to thumbnail files. To identify the user or group, you can specify the canonical user ID for an AWS account, an origin access identity for a CloudFront distribution, the registered email address of an AWS account, or a predefined Amazon S3 group.     Access: The permission that you want to give to the AWS user that you specified in Grantee. Permissions are granted on the thumbnail files that Elastic Transcoder adds to the bucket. Valid values include:     READ: The grantee can read the thumbnails and metadata for objects that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.    READ_ACP: The grantee can read the object ACL for thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.     WRITE_ACP: The grantee can write the ACL for the thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.    FULL_CONTROL: The grantee has READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions for the thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.       StorageClass: The Amazon S3 storage class, Standard or ReducedRedundancy, that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the thumbnails that it stores in your Amazon S3 bucket.

The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together.  The display aspect ratio of the video in the output file. Valid values include:  auto, 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9  If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder tries to preserve the aspect ratio of the input file. If you specify an aspect ratio for the output file that differs from aspect ratio  of the input file, Elastic Transcoder adds pillarboxing (black bars on the sides) or letterboxing  (black bars on the top and bottom) to maintain the aspect ratio of the active region  of the video.

        public let codec: String?
        ///  Profile (H.264/VP8/VP9 Only)  The H.264 profile that you want to use for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:    baseline: The profile most commonly used for videoconferencing and for mobile applications.    main: The profile used for standard-definition digital TV broadcasts.    high: The profile used for high-definition digital TV broadcasts and for Blu-ray discs.    Level (H.264 Only)  The H.264 level that you want to use for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following levels:  1, 1b, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 4, 4.1   MaxReferenceFrames (H.264 Only)  Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is H.264. The maximum number of  previously decoded frames to use as a reference for decoding future frames. Valid  values are integers 0 through 16, but we recommend that you not use a value greater  than the following:  Min(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks * 256 / (Width in pixels * Height in pixels)), 16)  where Width in pixels and Height in pixels represent either MaxWidth and MaxHeight, or Resolution. Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks depends on the value of the Level object. See the list below. (A macroblock is a block of pixels measuring 16x16.)    1 - 396   1b - 396   1.1 - 900   1.2 - 2376   1.3 - 2376   2 - 2376   2.1 - 4752   2.2 - 8100   3 - 8100   3.1 - 18000   3.2 - 20480   4 - 32768   4.1 - 32768    MaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)  The maximum number of bits per second in a video buffer; the size of the buffer is specified by BufferSize. Specify a value between 16 and 62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth required to stream a video by reducing the maximum bit rate, but this also reduces the quality of the video.  BufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)  The maximum number of bits in any x seconds of the output video. This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard segment duration when you're using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the container type of the output video. Specify an integer greater than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize, Elastic Transcoder sets BufferSize to 10 times the value of MaxBitRate.  InterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)  The interlace mode for the output video. Interlaced video is used to double the perceived frame rate for a video by interlacing  two fields (one field on every other line, the other field on the other lines) so that the  human eye registers multiple pictures per frame. Interlacing reduces the bandwidth required  for transmitting a video, but can result in blurred images and flickering. Valid values include Progressive (no interlacing, top to bottom), TopFirst (top field first), BottomFirst (bottom field first), and Auto. If InterlaceMode is not specified, Elastic Transcoder uses Progressive for the output. If Auto is specified, Elastic Transcoder interlaces the output.  ColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)  The color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies to the output video. Color spaces are the algorithms used by the computer to store information about how to render color. Bt.601 is the standard for standard definition video, while Bt.709 is the standard for high definition video. Valid values include None, Bt709toBt601, Bt601toBt709, and Auto. If you chose Auto for ColorSpaceConversionMode and your output is interlaced, your frame rate is one of 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97, 50, or 60, your SegmentDuration is null, and you are using one of the resolution changes from the list below, Elastic Transcoder applies the following color space conversions:    Standard to HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709     Standard to HD, 720x576 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709     HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x480 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601     HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x576 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601     Elastic Transcoder may change the behavior of the ColorspaceConversionMode Auto mode in the future. All outputs in a playlist must use the same ColorSpaceConversionMode.  If you do not specify a ColorSpaceConversionMode, Elastic Transcoder does not change the color space of a file. If you are unsure what ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied to  your output file, you can check the AppliedColorSpaceConversion parameter included in  your job response. If your job does not have an AppliedColorSpaceConversion in its  response, no ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied.  ChromaSubsampling  The sampling pattern for the chroma (color) channels of the output video. Valid values include yuv420p and yuv422p.  yuv420p samples the chroma information of every other horizontal and every other vertical line, yuv422p samples the color information of every horizontal line and every other  vertical line.
        ///   LoopCount (Gif Only)  The number of times you want the output gif to loop. Valid values include Infinite and  integers between 0 and 100, inclusive.

Valid values are true and false:    true: Elastic Transcoder uses the value of KeyframesMaxDist for the distance between key frames (the number of frames in a group of pictures, or GOP).    false: The distance between key frames can vary.     FixedGOP must be set to true for fmp4 containers.
        public let fixedGOP: String?
        /// The frames per second for the video stream in the output file. Valid values include:  auto, 10, 15, 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 60  If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder uses the detected frame rate of the input source. If you specify a frame rate, we recommend that you perform the following calculation:  Frame rate = maximum recommended decoding speed in luma samples/second / (width in pixels * height in pixels)  where:    width in pixels and height in pixels represent the Resolution of the output video.    maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second is less than or equal to the maximum value listed in the following table, based on the value that you specified for Level.   The maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second for each level is described in the following list (Level - Decoding speed):   1 - 380160   1b - 380160   1.1 - 76800   1.2 - 1536000   1.3 - 3041280   2 - 3041280   2.1 - 5068800   2.2 - 5184000   3 - 10368000   3.1 - 27648000   3.2 - 55296000   4 - 62914560   4.1 - 62914560
        public let frameRate: String?
        /// Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264, MPEG2,  or VP8. The maximum number of frames between key frames. Key frames are fully encoded frames;  the frames between key frames are encoded based, in part, on the content of the key frames.  The value is an integer formatted as a string; valid values are between 1 (every frame is a  key frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher value results in higher compression but may also  discernibly decrease video quality. For Smooth outputs, the FrameRate must have a constant ratio to the KeyframesMaxDist. This allows Smooth playlists to switch between different quality levels while the file is being played. For example, an input file can have a FrameRate of 30 with a KeyframesMaxDist of 90. The output file then needs to have a ratio of 1:3. Valid outputs would have FrameRate of 30, 25, and 10, and KeyframesMaxDist of 90, 75, and 30, respectively. Alternately, this can be achieved by setting FrameRate to auto and having the same values for MaxFrameRate and KeyframesMaxDist.

        /// If you specify auto for FrameRate, Elastic Transcoder uses the frame rate of the input video for the frame rate of the output video.

Valid values are auto and width x height:    auto: Elastic Transcoder attempts to preserve the width and height of the input file, subject to the following rules.     width x height : The width and height of the output video in pixels.   Note the following about specifying the width and height:   The width must be an even integer between 128 and 4096, inclusive.   The height must be an even integer between 96 and 3072, inclusive.   If you specify a resolution that is less than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output file to the lower resolution.   If you specify a resolution that is greater than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output to the higher resolution.   We recommend that you specify a resolution for which the product of width and height is less than or equal to the applicable value in the following list (List - Max width x height value):   1 - 25344   1b - 25344   1.1 - 101376   1.2 - 101376   1.3 - 101376   2 - 101376   2.1 - 202752   2.2 - 404720   3 - 404720   3.1 - 921600   3.2 - 1310720   4 - 2097152   4.1 - 2097152

Fill: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video so it matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or MaxHeight and matches or exceeds the other value. Elastic Transcoder centers the output video and then crops it in the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.    Stretch: Elastic Transcoder stretches the output video to match the values that you specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight. If the relative proportions of the input video and the output video are different, the output video will be distorted.    Keep: Elastic Transcoder does not scale the output video. If either dimension of the input video exceeds the values that you specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight, Elastic Transcoder crops the output video.    ShrinkToFit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video down so that its dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without exceeding either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the video up.    ShrinkToFill: Elastic Transcoder scales the output video down so that its dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without dropping below either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the video up.

Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to display a watermark that is not  rectangular, use the .png format, which supports transparency. When you create a job that uses this preset, you specify the .png or .jpg graphics that  you want Elastic Transcoder to include in the transcoded videos.
