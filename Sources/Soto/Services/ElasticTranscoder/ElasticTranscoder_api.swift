This is the ARN that Amazon SNS returned when you created the topic. For more information, see Create a Topic in the Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide.    Complete: The topic ARN for the Amazon SNS topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder has finished processing a job in this pipeline. This is the ARN that Amazon SNS returned when you created the topic.    Warning: The topic ARN for the Amazon SNS topic that you want to notify when Elastic Transcoder encounters a warning condition while processing a job in this pipeline.

You can grant permissions to a maximum of 30 users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups.    GranteeType: Specify the type of value that appears in the Grantee object:     Canonical: The value in the Grantee object is either the canonical user ID for an AWS account or an origin access identity for an Amazon CloudFront distribution.   A canonical user ID is not the same as an AWS account number.     Email: The value in the Grantee object is the registered email address of an AWS account.     Group: The value in the Grantee object is one of the following predefined Amazon S3 groups: AllUsers, AuthenticatedUsers, or LogDelivery.      Grantee: The AWS user or group that you want to have access to thumbnail files. To identify the user or group, you can specify the canonical user ID for an AWS account, an origin access identity for a CloudFront distribution, the registered email address of an AWS account, or a predefined Amazon S3 group.     Access: The permission that you want to give to the AWS user that you specified in Grantee. Permissions are granted on the thumbnail files that Elastic Transcoder adds to the bucket. Valid values include:     READ: The grantee can read the thumbnails and metadata for objects that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.    READ_ACP: The grantee can read the object ACL for thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.     WRITE_ACP: The grantee can write the ACL for the thumbnails that Elastic Transcoder adds to the Amazon S3 bucket.
