    /// Use this action to associate one or more Domain Name Server (DNS) aliases with an existing Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system. A file systen can have a maximum of 50 DNS aliases associated with it at any one time. If you try to associate a DNS alias that is already associated with the file system, FSx takes no action on that alias in the request. For more information, see Working with DNS Aliases and Walkthrough 5: Using DNS aliases to access your file system, including additional steps you must take to be able to access your file system using a DNS alias. The system response shows the DNS aliases that Amazon FSx is attempting to associate with the file system. Use the API operation to monitor the status of the aliases Amazon FSx is associating with the file system.

Any files that FSx has already exported are not reverted.   FSx continues to export any files that are "in-flight" when the cancel operation is received.   FSx does not export any files that have not yet been exported.

    /// Copies an existing backup within the same AWS account to another Region (cross-Region copy) or within the same Region (in-Region copy). You can have up to five backup copy requests in progress to a single destination Region per account. You can use cross-Region backup copies for cross-region disaster recovery. You periodically take backups and copy them to another Region so that in the event of a disaster in the primary Region, you can restore from backup and recover availability quickly in the other Region. You can make cross-Region copies only within your AWS partition.  You can also use backup copies to clone your file data set to another Region or within the same Region. You can use the SourceRegion parameter to specify the AWS Region from which the backup will be copied. For example, if you make the call from the us-west-1 Region and want to copy a backup from the us-east-2 Region, you specify us-east-2 in the SourceRegion parameter to make a cross-Region copy. If you don't specify a Region, the backup copy is created in the same Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy). For more information on creating backup copies, see  Copying backups in the Amazon FSx for Windows User Guide and Copying backups in the Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide.

    }

    /// Creates a backup of an existing Amazon FSx file system. Creating regular backups for your file system is a best practice, enabling you to restore a file system from a backup if an issue arises with the original file system. For Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, you can create a backup only for file systems with the following configuration:   a Persistent deployment type   is not linked to a data respository.   For more information about backing up Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, see Working with FSx for Lustre backups. For more information about backing up Amazon FSx for Windows file systems, see Working with FSx for Windows backups. If a backup with the specified client request token exists, and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the existing backup. If a backup specified client request token exists, and the parameters don't match, this operation returns IncompatibleParameterError. If a backup with the specified client request token doesn't exist, CreateBackup does the following:    Creates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of CREATING.   Returns the description of the backup.   By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateBackup operation without the risk of creating an extra backup. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a backup was created. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a backup, the operation returns a successful result because all the parameters are the same. The CreateBackup operation returns while the backup's lifecycle state is still CREATING. You can check the backup creation status by calling the DescribeBackups operation, which returns the backup state along with other information.

Returns the description of the file system.   This operation requires a client request token in the request that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent creation. This means that calling the operation multiple times with the same client request token has no effect. By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateFileSystem operation without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client receives success as long as the parameters are the same.
