Data repository associations are supported only for Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems with the Persistent_2 deployment type and for Amazon File Cache resources.  You can use filters to narrow the response to include just data repository associations for specific file systems (use the file-system-id filter with the ID of the file system) or caches (use the file-cache-id filter with the ID of the cache), or data repository associations for a specific repository type (use the data-repository-type filter with a value of S3 or NFS). If you don't use filters, the response returns all data repository associations owned by your Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region of the endpoint that you're calling.  When retrieving all data repository associations, you can paginate the response by using the optional MaxResults parameter to limit the number of data repository associations returned in a response. If more data repository associations remain, a NextToken value is returned in the response. In this case, send a later request with the NextToken request parameter set to the value of NextToken from the last response.
