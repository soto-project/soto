A file system can have a maximum of 50 DNS aliases associated with it at any one time. If you try to  associate a DNS alias that is already associated with the file system, FSx takes no action on that alias in the request.  For more information, see Working with DNS Aliases and  Walkthrough 5: Using DNS aliases to access your file system, including additional steps you must take to be able to access your file system using a DNS alias. The system response shows the DNS aliases that  Amazon FSx is attempting to associate with the file system.  Use the  API  operation to monitor the status of the aliases Amazon FSx is  associating with the file system.

FSx does not export any files that have not yet been exported.

    /// Copies an existing backup within the same Amazon Web Services account to another Amazon Web Services Region (cross-Region copy) or within the same Amazon Web Services Region (in-Region copy). You can have up to five backup copy requests in progress to a single destination Region per account. You can use cross-Region backup copies for cross-Region disaster recovery. You can periodically take backups and copy them to another Region so that in the event of a disaster in the primary Region, you can restore from backup and recover availability quickly in the other Region. You can make cross-Region copies only within your Amazon Web Services partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. Amazon Web Services currently has three partitions: aws (Standard Regions), aws-cn (China Regions), and aws-us-gov (Amazon Web Services GovCloud [US] Regions). You can also use backup copies to clone your file dataset to another Region or within the same Region. You can use the SourceRegion parameter to specify the Amazon Web Services Region from which the backup will be copied. For example, if you make the call from the us-west-1 Region and want to copy a backup from the us-east-2 Region, you specify us-east-2 in the SourceRegion parameter to make a cross-Region copy. If you don't specify a Region, the backup copy is created in the same Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy). For more information about creating backup copies, see  Copying backups in the Amazon FSx for Windows User Guide, Copying backups in the Amazon FSx for Lustre User Guide, and Copying backups in the Amazon FSx for OpenZFS User Guide.

We recommend creating regular backups so that you can restore a file system or volume from a backup if an issue arises with the original file system or volume. For Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, you can create a backup only for file systems that have the following configuration:   A Persistent deployment type   Are not linked to a data repository   For more information about backups, see the following:   For Amazon FSx for Lustre, see Working with FSx for Lustre backups.
