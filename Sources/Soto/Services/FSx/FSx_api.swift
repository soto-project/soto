    /// Creates a new Amazon FSx for Lustre, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, or Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system from an existing Amazon FSx backup. If a file system with the specified client request token exists and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the file system. If a file system with the specified client request token exists but the parameters don't match, this call returns IncompatibleParameterError. If a file system with the specified client request token doesn't exist, this operation does the following:   Creates a new Amazon FSx file system from backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of CREATING.   Returns the description of the file system.   Parameters like the Active Directory, default share name, automatic backup, and backup settings default to the parameters of the file system that was backed up, unless overridden. You can explicitly supply other settings. By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateFileSystemFromBackup call without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client receives a success message as long as the parameters are the same.  The CreateFileSystemFromBackup call returns while the file system's lifecycle state is still CREATING. You can check the file-system creation status by calling the  DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns the file system state along with other information.
    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - backupId: 
    ///   - clientRequestToken: A string of up to 63 ASCII characters that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent creation. This string is automatically filled on your behalf when you use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or an Amazon Web Services SDK.
    ///   - fileSystemTypeVersion: Sets the version for the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system that you're creating from a backup. Valid values are 2.10, 2.12, and 2.15. You can enter a Lustre version that is newer than the backup's FileSystemTypeVersion setting. If you don't enter a newer Lustre version, it defaults to the backup's setting.
    ///   - kmsKeyId: 
    ///   - lustreConfiguration: 
    ///   - openZFSConfiguration: The OpenZFS configuration for the file system that's being created.
    ///   - securityGroupIds: A list of IDs for the security groups that apply to the specified network interfaces created for file system access. These security groups apply to all network interfaces. This value isn't returned in later DescribeFileSystem requests.
    ///   - storageCapacity: Sets the storage capacity of the OpenZFS file system that you're creating from a backup, in gibibytes (GiB). Valid values are from 64 GiB up to 524,288 GiB (512 TiB). However, the value that you specify must be equal to or greater than the backup's storage capacity value. If you don't use the StorageCapacity parameter, the default is the backup's StorageCapacity value. If used to create a file system other than OpenZFS, you must provide a value that matches the backup's StorageCapacity value. If you provide any other value, Amazon FSx responds with an HTTP status code 400 Bad Request.
    ///   - storageType: Sets the storage type for the Windows or OpenZFS file system that you're creating from a backup. Valid values are SSD and HDD.   Set to SSD to use solid state drive storage. SSD is supported on all Windows and OpenZFS deployment types.   Set to HDD to use hard disk drive storage.  HDD is supported on SINGLE_AZ_2 and MULTI_AZ_1 FSx for Windows File Server file system deployment types.   The default value is SSD.   HDD and SSD storage types have different minimum storage capacity requirements.  A restored file system's storage capacity is tied to the file system that was backed up.  You can create a file system that uses HDD storage from a backup of a file system that  used SSD storage if the original SSD file system had a storage capacity of at least 2000 GiB.
    ///   - subnetIds: Specifies the IDs of the subnets that the file system will be accessible from. For Windows MULTI_AZ_1  file system deployment types, provide exactly two subnet IDs, one for the preferred file server  and one for the standby file server. You specify one of these subnets as the preferred subnet  using the WindowsConfiguration > PreferredSubnetID property. Windows SINGLE_AZ_1 and SINGLE_AZ_2 file system deployment types, Lustre file systems, and OpenZFS file systems provide exactly one subnet ID. The file server is launched in that subnet's Availability Zone.

To delete an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system, first delete all the volumes and storage virtual machines (SVMs) on the file system. Then provide a FileSystemId value to the DeleteFileSystem operation. By default, when you delete an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, a final backup is created upon deletion.

To delete an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, first  unmount it from every connected Amazon EC2 instance, then provide a FileSystemId value to the DeleteFileSystem operation. By default, Amazon FSx will not take a final backup when the DeleteFileSystem operation is invoked. On file systems not linked to an Amazon S3 bucket, set SkipFinalBackup to false to take a final backup of the file system you are deleting. Backups cannot be enabled on S3-linked file systems. To ensure all of your data is written back to S3 before deleting your file system, you can either monitor for the AgeOfOldestQueuedMessage metric to be zero (if using automatic export) or you can run an export data repository task. If you have automatic export enabled and want to use an export data repository task, you have to disable automatic export before executing the export data repository task. The DeleteFileSystem operation returns while the file system has the DELETING status. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass the file system ID for a deleted file system, the DescribeFileSystems operation returns a FileSystemNotFound error.

    /// Deletes a file system. After deletion, the file system no longer exists, and its data is gone. Any existing automatic backups and snapshots are also deleted. To delete an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system, first delete all the volumes and storage virtual machines (SVMs) on the file system. Then provide a FileSystemId value to the DeleteFileSystem operation. By default, when you delete an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system, a final backup is created upon deletion. This final backup isn't subject to the file system's retention policy, and must be manually deleted. To delete an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, first  unmount it from every connected Amazon EC2 instance, then provide a FileSystemId value to the DeleteFileSystem operation. By default, Amazon FSx will not take a final backup when the DeleteFileSystem operation is invoked. On file systems not linked to an Amazon S3 bucket, set SkipFinalBackup to false to take a final backup of the file system you are deleting. Backups cannot be enabled on S3-linked file systems. To ensure all of your data is written back to S3 before deleting your file system, you can either monitor for the AgeOfOldestQueuedMessage metric to be zero (if using automatic export) or you can run an export data repository task. If you have automatic export enabled and want to use an export data repository task, you have to disable automatic export before executing the export data repository task. The DeleteFileSystem operation returns while the file system has the DELETING status. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass the file system ID for a deleted file system, the DescribeFileSystems operation returns a FileSystemNotFound error.  If a data repository task is in a PENDING or EXECUTING state, deleting an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system will fail with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request).   The data in a deleted file system is also deleted and can't be recovered by any means.

For FSx for OpenZFS file systems, the storage capacity target value must be at least 10 percent greater than the current storage capacity value. For more information, see Managing storage capacity in the FSx for OpenZFS User Guide. For Windows file systems, the storage capacity target value must be at least 10 percent greater than the current storage capacity value. To increase storage capacity, the file system must have at least 16 MBps of throughput capacity.
