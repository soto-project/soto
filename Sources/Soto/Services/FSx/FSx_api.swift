    /// Copies an existing backup within the same Amazon Web Services account to another Amazon Web Services Region (cross-Region copy) or within the same Amazon Web Services Region (in-Region copy). You can have up to five backup copy requests in progress to a single destination Region per account. You can use cross-Region backup copies for cross-Region disaster recovery. You can periodically take backups and copy them to another Region so that in the event of a disaster in the primary Region, you can restore from backup and recover availability quickly in the other Region. You can make cross-Region copies only within your Amazon Web Services partition. A partition is a grouping of Regions. Amazon Web Services currently has three partitions: aws (Standard Regions), aws-cn (China Regions), and aws-us-gov (Amazon Web Services GovCloud [US] Regions). You can also use backup copies to clone your file dataset to another Region or within the same Region. You can use the SourceRegion parameter to specify the Amazon Web Services Region from which the backup will be copied. For example, if you make the call from the us-west-1 Region and want to copy a backup from the us-east-2 Region, you specify us-east-2 in the SourceRegion parameter to make a cross-Region copy. If you don't specify a Region, the backup copy is created in the same Region where the request is sent from (in-Region copy).

On file systems not linked to an Amazon S3 bucket, set SkipFinalBackup to false to take a final backup of the file system you are deleting. Backups cannot be enabled on S3-linked file systems. To ensure all of your data is written back to S3 before deleting your file system, you can either monitor for the AgeOfOldestQueuedMessage metric to be zero (if using automatic export) or you can run an export data repository task. If you have automatic export enabled and want to use an export data repository task, you have to disable automatic export before executing the export data repository task. The DeleteFileSystem operation returns while the file system has the DELETING status. You can check the file system deletion status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns a list of file systems in your account. If you pass the file system ID for a deleted file system, the DescribeFileSystems operation returns a FileSystemNotFound error.  If a data repository task is in a PENDING or EXECUTING state, deleting an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system will fail with an HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request).   The data in a deleted file system is also deleted and can't be recovered by any means.
