    /// Creates an access configuration for your documents. This includes  user and group access information for your documents. This is useful  for user context filtering, where search results are filtered based  on the user or their group access to documents. You can use this to re-configure your existing document level access control without indexing all of your documents again. For example, your index contains top-secret company documents that only certain employees or users should access. One of these users leaves the company or switches to a team that should be blocked from accessing  top-secret documents. The user still has access to top-secret documents because the user  had access when your documents were previously indexed. You  can create a specific access control configuration for the user with deny  access. You can later update the access control configuration to allow access if the  user returns to the company and re-joins the 'top-secret' team. You can re-configure  access control for your documents as circumstances change. To apply your access control configuration to certain documents, you call  the BatchPutDocument  API with the AccessControlConfigurationId included in the  Document  object. If you use an S3 bucket as a data source, you update the  .metadata.json with the AccessControlConfigurationId  and synchronize your data source. Amazon Kendra currently only supports  access control configuration for S3 data sources and documents indexed using the  BatchPutDocument API.
