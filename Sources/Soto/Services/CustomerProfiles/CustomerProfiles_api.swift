/// Amazon Connect Customer Profiles    Customer Profiles actions     Customer Profiles data types    Amazon Connect Customer Profiles is a unified customer profile for your contact center that has pre-built connectors powered by AppFlow that make it easy to combine customer information from third party applications, such as Salesforce (CRM), ServiceNow (ITSM), and your enterprise resource planning (ERP), with contact history from your Amazon Connect contact center.  For more information about the Amazon Connect Customer Profiles feature, see Use Customer Profiles in the Amazon Connect Administrator's Guide.
