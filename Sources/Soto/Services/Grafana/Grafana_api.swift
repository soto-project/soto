/// Service object for interacting with AWS Grafana service.
///
/// Amazon Managed Grafana is a fully managed and secure data visualization service that you can use to instantly query, correlate, and visualize operational metrics, logs, and traces from multiple sources. Amazon Managed Grafana makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Grafana, a widely deployed data visualization tool that is popular for its extensible data support. With Amazon Managed Grafana, you create logically isolated Grafana servers called workspaces. In a workspace, you can create Grafana dashboards and visualizations to analyze your metrics, logs, and traces without having to build, package, or deploy any hardware to run Grafana servers.

    ///   - authenticationProviders: Specifies whether this workspace uses SAML 2.0, IAM Identity Center, or both to authenticate users for using the Grafana console within a workspace. For more information, see User authentication in Amazon Managed Grafana.
    ///   - clientToken: A unique, case-sensitive, user-provided identifier to ensure the idempotency of the request.
    ///   - configuration: The configuration string for the workspace that you create. For more information about the format and configuration options available, see Working in your Grafana workspace.
    ///   - grafanaVersion: Specifies the version of Grafana to support in the new workspace. If not specified,  defaults to the latest version (for example, 10.4). To get a list of supported versions, use the ListVersions operation.
    ///   - networkAccessControl: Configuration for network access to your workspace. When this is configured, only listed IP addresses and VPC endpoints will be able to access your workspace. Standard Grafana authentication and authorization will still be required. If this is not configured, or is removed, then all IP addresses and VPC endpoints will be allowed. Standard Grafana authentication and authorization will still be required.
    ///   - organizationRoleName: The name of an IAM role that already exists to use with Organizations to access Amazon Web Services data sources and notification channels in other accounts in an organization.
    ///   - permissionType: When creating a workspace through the Amazon Web Services API, CLI or Amazon Web Services CloudFormation, you must manage IAM roles and provision the permissions that the workspace needs to use Amazon Web Services data sources and notification channels. You must also specify a workspaceRoleArn for a role that you will manage for the workspace to use when accessing those datasources and notification  channels. The ability for Amazon Managed Grafana to create and update IAM roles on behalf of the user is supported only in the Amazon Managed Grafana console, where this value may be set to SERVICE_MANAGED.  Use only the CUSTOMER_MANAGED permission type when creating a workspace with the API, CLI or Amazon Web Services CloudFormation.   For more information, see Amazon Managed Grafana permissions and policies for Amazon Web Services data sources and notification channels.
    ///   - stackSetName: The name of the CloudFormation stack set to use to generate IAM roles to be used for this workspace.
    ///   - tags: The list of tags associated with the workspace.

    ///   - workspaceDataSources: This parameter is for internal use only, and should not be used.

    ///   - workspaceName: The name for the workspace. It does not have to be unique.
    ///   - workspaceNotificationDestinations: Specify the Amazon Web Services notification channels that you plan to use in this workspace. Specifying these data sources here enables Amazon Managed Grafana to create IAM roles and permissions that allow Amazon Managed Grafana to use these channels.
    ///   - workspaceOrganizationalUnits: Specifies the organizational units that this workspace is allowed to use data sources from, if this workspace is in an account that is part of an organization.
    ///   - workspaceRoleArn: Specified the IAM role that grants permissions to the Amazon Web Services resources that the workspace will view data from, including both data  sources and notification channels.
