MediaConnect is a service that lets you ingest live video content into the cloud and distribute it to destinations all over the world, both inside and outside the Amazon Web Services cloud. This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types that are supported by MediaConnect.  Use the following links to get started with the MediaConnect API:    Actions: An alphabetical list of all MediaConnect API operations.    Data types: An alphabetical list of all MediaConnect data types.    Common parameters: Parameters that all operations can use.    Common errors: Client and server errors that all operations can return.

    ///   - description: A description of the source. This description is not visible outside of the current Amazon Web Services account.
    ///   - entitlementArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entitlement that allows you to subscribe to the flow. The entitlement is set by the content originator, and the ARN is generated as part of the originator's flow.
    ///   - flowArn: The ARN of the flow that you want to update.
    ///   - gatewayBridgeSource: The source configuration for cloud flows receiving a stream from a bridge.
    ///   - ingestPort: The port that the flow listens on for incoming content. If the protocol of the source is Zixi, the port must be set to 2088.
    ///   - maxBitrate: The maximum bitrate for RIST, RTP, and RTP-FEC streams.
    ///   - maxLatency: The maximum latency in milliseconds. This parameter applies only to RIST-based and Zixi-based streams.
    ///   - maxSyncBuffer: The size of the buffer (in milliseconds) to use to sync incoming source data.
    ///   - mediaStreamSourceConfigurations: The media stream that is associated with the source, and the parameters for that association.
    ///   - minLatency: The minimum latency in milliseconds for SRT-based streams. In streams that use the SRT protocol, this value that you set on your MediaConnect source or output represents the minimal potential latency of that connection. The latency of the stream is set to the highest number between the sender’s minimum latency and the receiver’s minimum latency.
    ///   - protocol: The protocol that the source uses to deliver the content to MediaConnect.
    ///   - senderControlPort: The port that the flow uses to send outbound requests to initiate connection with the sender.
    ///   - senderIpAddress: The IP address that the flow communicates with to initiate connection with the sender.
    ///   - sourceArn: The ARN of the source that you want to update.
    ///   - sourceListenerAddress: The source IP or domain name for SRT-caller protocol.
    ///   - sourceListenerPort: Source port for SRT-caller protocol.
    ///   - streamId: The stream ID that you want to use for this transport. This parameter applies only to Zixi and SRT caller-based streams.
    ///   - vpcInterfaceName: The name of the VPC interface that you want to send your output to.
    ///   - whitelistCidr: The range of IP addresses that are allowed to contribute content to your source. Format the IP addresses as a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0/16.
