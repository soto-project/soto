/// Service object for interacting with AWS ConfigService service.
///
/// Config Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations
/// 			of all the Amazon Web Services resources associated with your Amazon Web Services account. You can
/// 			use Config to get the current and historical configurations of
/// 			each Amazon Web Services resource and also to get information about the relationship
/// 			between the resources. An Amazon Web Services resource can be an Amazon Compute
/// 			Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an
/// 			elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete
/// 			list of resources currently supported by Config, see Supported Amazon Web Services resources. You can access and manage Config through the Amazon Web Services Management
/// 			Console, the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface (Amazon Web Services CLI), the Config
/// 			API, or the Amazon Web Services SDKs for Config. This reference guide contains
/// 			documentation for the Config API and the Amazon Web Services CLI commands that
/// 			you can use to manage Config. The Config API uses the
/// 			Signature Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more
/// 			information about how to sign a request with this protocol, see
/// 				Signature
/// 				Version 4 Signing Process. For detailed information
/// 			about Config features and their associated actions or commands,
/// 			as well as how to work with Amazon Web Services Management Console, see What Is Config in the Config Developer
/// 				Guide.
