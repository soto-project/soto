    // MARK: API Calls

    /// Retrieves a list of documents that match the specified search criteria. How you specify the search criteria depends on which query parser you use. Amazon CloudSearch supports four query parsers:  simple: search all text and text-array fields for the specified string. Search for phrases, individual terms, and prefixes.  structured: search specific fields, construct compound queries using Boolean operators, and use advanced features such as term boosting and proximity searching. lucene: specify search criteria using the Apache Lucene query parser syntax. dismax: specify search criteria using the simplified subset of the Apache Lucene query parser syntax defined by the DisMax query parser.  For more information, see Searching Your Data in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide. The endpoint for submitting Search requests is domain-specific. You submit search requests to a domain's search endpoint. To get the search endpoint for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service DescribeDomains action. A domain's endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - cursor: Retrieves a cursor value you can use to page through large result sets. Use the size parameter to control the number of hits to include in each response. You can specify either the cursor or start parameter in a request; they are mutually exclusive. To get the first cursor, set the cursor value to initial. In subsequent requests, specify the cursor value returned in the hits section of the response.  For more information, see Paginating Results in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide.
    ///   - expr: Defines one or more numeric expressions that can be used to sort results or specify search or filter criteria. You can also specify expressions as return fields.  You specify the expressions in JSON using the form {"EXPRESSIONNAME":"EXPRESSION"}. You can define and use multiple expressions in a search request. For example:  {"expression1":"_score*rating", "expression2":"(1/rank)*year"}  For information about the variables, operators, and functions you can use in expressions, see Writing Expressions in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide.
    ///   - facet: Specifies one or more fields for which to get facet information, and options that control how the facet information is returned. Each specified field must be facet-enabled in the domain configuration. The fields and options are specified in JSON using the form {"FIELD":{"OPTION":VALUE,"OPTION:"STRING"},"FIELD":{"OPTION":VALUE,"OPTION":"STRING"}}. You can specify the following faceting options:   buckets specifies an array of the facet values or ranges to count. Ranges are specified using the same syntax that you use to search for a range of values. For more information, see  Searching for a Range of Values in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide. Buckets are returned in the order they are specified in the request. The sort and size options are not valid if you specify buckets.   size specifies the maximum number of facets to include in the results. By default, Amazon CloudSearch returns counts for the top 10. The size parameter is only valid when you specify the sort option; it cannot be used in conjunction with buckets.   sort specifies how you want to sort the facets in the results: bucket or count. Specify bucket to sort alphabetically or numerically by facet value (in ascending order). Specify count to sort by the facet counts computed for each facet value (in descending order). To retrieve facet counts for particular values or ranges of values, use the buckets option instead of sort.    If no facet options are specified, facet counts are computed for all field values, the facets are sorted by facet count, and the top 10 facets are returned in the results.
    ///   - filterQuery: Specifies a structured query that filters the results of a search without affecting how the results are scored and sorted. You use filterQuery in conjunction with the query parameter to filter the documents that match the constraints specified in the query parameter. Specifying a filter controls only which matching documents are included in the results, it has no effect on how they are scored and sorted. The filterQuery parameter supports the full structured query syntax.  For more information about using filters, see Filtering Matching Documents in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide.
    ///   - highlight: Retrieves highlights for matches in the specified text or text-array fields. Each specified field must be highlight enabled in the domain configuration. The fields and options are specified in JSON using the form {"FIELD":{"OPTION":VALUE,"OPTION:"STRING"},"FIELD":{"OPTION":VALUE,"OPTION":"STRING"}}. You can specify the following highlight options:   format: specifies the format of the data in the text field: text or html. When data is returned as HTML, all non-alphanumeric characters are encoded. The default is html.   max_phrases: specifies the maximum number of occurrences of the search term(s) you want to highlight. By default, the first occurrence is highlighted.   pre_tag: specifies the string to prepend to an occurrence of a search term. The default for HTML highlights is &lt;em&gt;. The default for text highlights is *.   post_tag: specifies the string to append to an occurrence of a search term. The default for HTML highlights is &lt;/em&gt;. The default for text highlights is *.   If no highlight options are specified for a field, the returned field text is treated as HTML and the first match is highlighted with emphasis tags:  &lt;em>search-term&lt;/em&gt;. For example, the following request retrieves highlights for the actors and title fields. { "actors": {}, "title": {"format": "text","max_phrases": 2,"pre_tag": "","post_tag": ""} }
    ///   - partial: Enables partial results to be returned if one or more index partitions are unavailable. When your search index is partitioned across multiple search instances, by default Amazon CloudSearch only returns results if every partition can be queried. This means that the failure of a single search instance can result in 5xx (internal server) errors. When you enable partial results, Amazon CloudSearch returns whatever results are available and includes the percentage of documents searched in the search results (percent-searched). This enables you to more gracefully degrade your users' search experience. For example, rather than displaying no results, you could display the partial results and a message indicating that the results might be incomplete due to a temporary system outage.
    ///   - query: Specifies the search criteria for the request. How you specify the search criteria depends on the query parser used for the request and the parser options specified in the queryOptions parameter. By default, the simple query parser is used to process requests. To use the structured, lucene, or dismax query parser, you must also specify the queryParser parameter.  For more information about specifying search criteria, see Searching Your Data in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide.
    ///   - queryOptions: Configures options for the query parser specified in the queryParser parameter. You specify the options in JSON using the following form {"OPTION1":"VALUE1","OPTION2":VALUE2"..."OPTIONN":"VALUEN"}.
    ///   - queryParser: Specifies which query parser to use to process the request. If queryParser is not specified, Amazon CloudSearch uses the simple query parser.  Amazon CloudSearch supports four query parsers:   simple: perform simple searches of text and text-array fields. By default, the simple query parser searches all text and text-array fields. You can specify which fields to search by with the queryOptions parameter. If you prefix a search term with a plus sign (+) documents must contain the term to be considered a match. (This is the default, unless you configure the default operator with the queryOptions parameter.) You can use the - (NOT), | (OR), and * (wildcard) operators to exclude particular terms, find results that match any of the specified terms, or search for a prefix. To search for a phrase rather than individual terms, enclose the phrase in double quotes. For more information, see Searching for Text in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide.   structured: perform advanced searches by combining multiple expressions to define the search criteria. You can also search within particular fields, search for values and ranges of values, and use advanced options such as term boosting, matchall, and near. For more information, see Constructing Compound Queries in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide.   lucene: search using the Apache Lucene query parser syntax. For more information, see Apache Lucene Query Parser Syntax.   dismax: search using the simplified subset of the Apache Lucene query parser syntax defined by the DisMax query parser. For more information, see DisMax Query Parser Syntax.
    ///   - return: Specifies the field and expression values to include in the response. Multiple fields or expressions are specified as a comma-separated list. By default, a search response includes all return enabled fields (_all_fields). To  return only the document IDs for the matching documents, specify _no_fields. To retrieve the relevance score calculated for each document, specify _score.
    ///   - size: Specifies the maximum number of search hits to include in the response.
    ///   - sort: Specifies the fields or custom expressions to use to sort the search results. Multiple fields or expressions are specified as a comma-separated list. You must specify the sort direction (asc or desc) for each field; for example, year desc,title asc. To use a field to sort results, the field must be sort-enabled in the domain configuration. Array type fields cannot be used for sorting. If no sort parameter is specified, results are sorted by their default relevance scores in descending order: _score desc. You can also sort by document ID (_id asc) and version (_version desc). For more information, see Sorting Results in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide.
    ///   - start: Specifies the offset of the first search hit you want to return. Note that the result set is zero-based; the first result is at index 0. You can specify either the start or cursor parameter in a request, they are mutually exclusive.   For more information, see Paginating Results in the Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide.
    ///   - stats: Specifies one or more fields for which to get statistics information. Each specified field must be facet-enabled in the domain configuration. The fields are specified in JSON using the form: {"FIELD-A":{},"FIELD-B":{}} There are currently no options supported for statistics.
