For more information, see Batch service IAM role in the Batch User Guide.  If your account already created the Batch service-linked role, that role is used by default for your compute environment unless you specify a different role here. If the Batch service-linked role doesn't exist in your account, and no role is specified here, the service attempts to create the Batch service-linked role in your account.  If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must specify either the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name bar has a path of /foo/, specify /foo/bar as the role name. For more information, see Friendly names and paths in the IAM User Guide.  Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the service-role path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.

If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand. If the state is DISABLED, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a STARTING or RUNNING state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the DISABLED state don't scale out.   Compute environments in a DISABLED state may continue to incur billing charges. To prevent additional charges, turn off and then delete the compute environment. For more information, see State in the Batch User Guide.  When an instance is idle, the instance scales down to the minvCpus value. However, the instance size doesn't change. For example, consider a c5.8xlarge instance with a minvCpus value of 4 and a desiredvCpus value of 36. This instance doesn't scale down to a c5.large instance.

Likewise, if the compute environment has a regular IAM role, it can't be changed to use a service-linked role. To update the parameters for the compute environment that require an infrastructure update to change, the AWSServiceRoleForBatch service-linked role must be used. For more information, see Updating compute environments in the Batch User Guide.  If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.  Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the service-role path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.

If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand. If the state is DISABLED, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a STARTING or RUNNING state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the DISABLED state don't scale out.   Compute environments in a DISABLED state may continue to incur billing charges. To prevent additional charges, turn off and then delete the compute environment. For more information, see State in the Batch User Guide.  When an instance is idle, the instance scales down to the minvCpus value. However, the instance size doesn't change. For example, consider a c5.8xlarge instance with a minvCpus value of 4 and a desiredvCpus value of 36. This instance doesn't scale down to a c5.large instance.
