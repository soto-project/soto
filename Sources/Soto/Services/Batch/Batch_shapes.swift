If there aren't enough instances available or the user is reaching Amazon EC2 service limits, additional jobs aren't run until the currently running jobs are completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you're using Spot Fleets with BEST_FIT, the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified.

SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED  Batch selects one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue.

With both BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE and SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED strategies using On-Demand or Spot Instances, and the BEST_FIT strategy using Spot Instances, Batch might need to exceed maxvCpus to meet your capacity requirements.

This parameter is supported for jobs that are running on EC2 resources. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified, the container is terminated. This parameter maps to Memory in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory option to docker run. You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job. This is required but can be specified in several places for multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. It must be specified for each node at least once. This parameter maps to Memory in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory option to docker run.  If you're trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see Memory management in the Batch User Guide.  For jobs that are running on Fargate resources, then value is the hard limit (in MiB), and must match one of the supported values and the VCPU values must be one of the values supported for that memory value.  value = 512   VCPU = 0.25  value = 1024   VCPU = 0.25 or 0.5  value = 2048   VCPU = 0.25, 0.5, or 1  value = 3072   VCPU = 0.5, or 1  value = 4096   VCPU = 0.5, 1, or 2  value = 5120, 6144, or 7168   VCPU = 1 or 2  value = 8192   VCPU = 1, 2, 4, or 8  value = 9216, 10240, 11264, 12288, 13312, 14336, or 15360   VCPU = 2 or 4  value = 16384   VCPU = 2, 4, or 8  value = 17408, 18432, 19456, 21504, 22528, 23552, 25600, 26624, 27648, 29696, or 30720   VCPU = 4  value = 20480, 24576, or 28672   VCPU = 4 or 8  value = 36864, 45056, 53248, or 61440   VCPU = 8  value = 32768, 40960, 49152, or 57344   VCPU = 8 or 16  value = 65536, 73728, 81920, 90112, 98304, 106496, 114688, or 122880   VCPU = 16    type="VCPU"  The number of vCPUs reserved for the container. This parameter maps to CpuShares in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --cpu-shares option to docker run. Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. For EC2 resources, you must specify at least one vCPU. This is required but can be specified in several places; it must be specified for each node at least once. The default for the Fargate On-Demand vCPU resource count quota is 6 vCPUs. For more information about Fargate quotas, see Fargate quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. For jobs that are running on Fargate resources, then value must match one of the supported values and the MEMORY values must be one of the values supported for that VCPU value.

Likewise, if the compute environment has a regular IAM role, it can't be changed to use a service-linked role. To update the parameters for the compute environment that require an infrastructure update to change, the AWSServiceRoleForBatch service-linked role must be used. For more information, see Updating compute environments in the Batch User Guide.  If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.  Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the service-role path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.
