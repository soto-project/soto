/// Service object for interacting with AWS Batch service.
///
/// Batch Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of the batch computing to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. You can use Batch to efficiently provision resources d, and work toward eliminating capacity constraints, reducing your overall compute costs, and delivering results more quickly. As a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific workloads. With Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus on analyzing results and solving your specific problems instead.

Jobs that progressed to the STARTING or RUNNING state aren't canceled. However, the API operation still succeeds, even if no job is canceled. These jobs must be terminated with the TerminateJob operation.

    /// Creates an Batch compute environment. You can create MANAGED or UNMANAGED compute environments. MANAGED compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or Fargate resources. UNMANAGED compute environments can only use EC2 resources. In a managed compute environment, Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the launch template that you specify when you create the compute environment. Either, you can choose to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances. Or, you can use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.  Multi-node parallel jobs aren't supported on Spot Instances.  In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMIs. However, you must verify that each of your AMIs meet the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see container instance AMIs in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. After you created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the DescribeComputeEnvironments operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that's associated with it. Then, launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see Launching an Amazon ECS container instance in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.  To create a compute environment that uses EKS resources, the caller must have permissions to call eks:DescribeCluster.   Batch doesn't automatically upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after it's created. For example, it also doesn't update the AMIs in your compute environment when a newer version of the Amazon ECS optimized AMI is available. You're responsible for the management of the guest operating system. This includes any updates and security patches. You're also responsible for any additional application software or utilities that you install on the compute resources. There are two ways to use a new AMI for your Batch jobs. The original method is to complete these steps:   Create a new compute environment with the new AMI.   Add the compute environment to an existing job queue.   Remove the earlier compute environment from your job queue.   Delete the earlier compute environment.   In April 2022, Batch added enhanced support for updating compute environments. For more information, see Updating compute environments. To use the enhanced updating of compute environments to update AMIs, follow these rules:   Either don't set the service role (serviceRole) parameter or set it to the AWSBatchServiceRole service-linked role.   Set the allocation strategy (allocationStrategy) parameter to BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE, SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED, or SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED.   Set the update to latest image version (updateToLatestImageVersion) parameter to true. The updateToLatestImageVersion parameter is used when you update a compute environment. This parameter is ignored when you create a compute environment.   Don't specify an AMI ID in imageId, imageIdOverride (in  ec2Configuration ), or in the launch template (launchTemplate). In that case, Batch selects the latest Amazon ECS optimized AMI that's supported by Batch at the time the infrastructure update is initiated. Alternatively, you can specify the AMI ID in the imageId or imageIdOverride parameters, or the launch template identified by the LaunchTemplate properties. Changing any of these properties starts an infrastructure update. If the AMI ID is specified in the launch template, it can't be replaced by specifying an AMI ID in either the imageId or imageIdOverride parameters. It can only be replaced by specifying a different launch template, or if the launch template version is set to $Default or $Latest, by setting either a new default version for the launch template (if $Default) or by adding a new version to the launch template (if $Latest).   If these rules are followed, any update that starts an infrastructure update causes the AMI ID to be re-selected. If the version setting in the launch template (launchTemplate) is set to $Latest or $Default, the latest or default version of the launch template is evaluated up at the time of the infrastructure update, even if the launchTemplate wasn't updated.
