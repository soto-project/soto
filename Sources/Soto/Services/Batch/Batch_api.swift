/// Service object for interacting with AWS Batch service.
///
/// Batch Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of the batch computing to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. You can use Batch to efficiently provision resources, and work toward eliminating capacity constraints, reducing your overall compute costs, and delivering results more quickly. As a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific workloads. With Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus on analyzing results and solving your specific problems instead.

    /// Creates an Batch compute environment. You can create MANAGED or UNMANAGED compute environments. MANAGED compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or Fargate resources. UNMANAGED compute environments can only use EC2 resources. In a managed compute environment, Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the launch template that you specify when you create the compute environment. Either, you can choose to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances. Or, you can use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.  Multi-node parallel jobs aren't supported on Spot Instances.  In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMIs. However, you must verify that each of your AMIs meet the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see container instance AMIs in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. After you created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the DescribeComputeEnvironments operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that's associated with it. Then, launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see Launching an Amazon ECS container instance in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.  To create a compute environment that uses EKS resources, the caller must have permissions to call eks:DescribeCluster.   Batch doesn't automatically upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after it's created. For example, it also doesn't update the AMIs in your compute environment when a newer version of the Amazon ECS optimized AMI is available. You're responsible for the management of the guest operating system. This includes any updates and security patches. You're also responsible for any additional application software or utilities that you install on the compute resources. There are two ways to use a new AMI for your Batch jobs. The original method is to complete these steps:   Create a new compute environment with the new AMI.   Add the compute environment to an existing job queue.   Remove the earlier compute environment from your job queue.   Delete the earlier compute environment.   In April 2022, Batch added enhanced support for updating compute environments. For more information, see Updating compute environments. To use the enhanced updating of compute environments to update AMIs, follow these rules:   Either don't set the service role (serviceRole) parameter or set it to the AWSBatchServiceRole service-linked role.   Set the allocation strategy (allocationStrategy) parameter to BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE, SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED, or SPOT_PRICE_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED.   Set the update to latest image version (updateToLatestImageVersion) parameter to true. The updateToLatestImageVersion parameter  is used when you update a compute environment. This parameter is ignored when you create  a compute environment.   Don't specify an AMI ID in imageId, imageIdOverride (in  ec2Configuration ), or in the launch template (launchTemplate). In that case, Batch selects the latest Amazon ECS optimized AMI that's supported by Batch at the time the infrastructure update is initiated. Alternatively, you can specify the AMI ID in the imageId or imageIdOverride parameters, or the launch template identified by the LaunchTemplate properties. Changing any of these properties starts an infrastructure update. If the AMI ID is specified in the launch template, it can't be replaced by specifying an AMI ID in either the imageId or imageIdOverride parameters. It can only be replaced by specifying a different launch template, or if the launch template version is set to $Default or $Latest, by setting either a new default version for the launch template (if $Default) or by adding a new version to the launch template (if $Latest).   If these rules are followed, any update that starts an infrastructure update causes the AMI ID to be re-selected. If the version setting in the launch template (launchTemplate) is set to $Latest or $Default, the latest or default version of the launch template is evaluated up at the time of the infrastructure update, even if the launchTemplate wasn't updated.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - computeEnvironmentName: The name for your compute environment. It can be up to 128 characters long. It can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
    ///   - computeResources: Details about the compute resources managed by the compute environment. This parameter is required for managed compute environments. For more information, see Compute Environments in the Batch User Guide.
    ///   - context: Reserved.
    ///   - eksConfiguration: The details for the Amazon EKS cluster that supports the compute environment.
    ///   - serviceRole: The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Batch to make calls to other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf. For more information, see Batch service IAM role in the Batch User Guide.  If your account already created the Batch service-linked role, that role is used by default for your compute environment unless you specify a different role here. If the Batch service-linked role doesn't exist in your account, and no role is specified here, the service attempts to create the Batch service-linked role in your account.  If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must specify either the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name bar has a path of /foo/, specify /foo/bar as the role name. For more information, see Friendly names and paths in the IAM User Guide.  Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the service-role path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.
    ///   - state: The state of the compute environment. If the state is ENABLED, then the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out automatically based on queues. If the state is ENABLED, then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand. If the state is DISABLED, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a STARTING or RUNNING state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the DISABLED state don't scale out.   Compute environments in a DISABLED state may continue to incur billing charges. To prevent additional charges, turn off and then delete the compute environment. For more information, see State in the Batch User Guide.  When an instance is idle, the instance scales down to the minvCpus value. However, the instance size doesn't change. For example, consider a c5.8xlarge instance with a minvCpus value of 4 and a desiredvCpus value of 36. This instance doesn't scale down to a c5.large instance.
    ///   - tags: The tags that you apply to the compute environment to help you categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources in Amazon Web Services General Reference. These tags can be updated or removed using the TagResource and UntagResource API operations. These tags don't propagate to the underlying compute resources.
    ///   - type: The type of the compute environment: MANAGED or UNMANAGED. For more information, see Compute Environments in the Batch User Guide.
    ///   - unmanagedvCpus: The maximum number of vCPUs for an unmanaged compute environment. This parameter is only used for fair-share scheduling to reserve vCPU capacity for new share identifiers. If this parameter isn't provided for a fair-share job queue, no vCPU capacity is reserved.  This parameter is only supported when the type parameter is set to UNMANAGED.

    ///   - jobQueueName: The name of the job queue. It can be up to 128 letters long. It can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).
    ///   - jobStateTimeLimitActions: The set of actions that Batch performs on jobs that remain at the head of the job queue in the specified state longer than specified times. Batch will perform each action after maxTimeSeconds has passed. (Note: The minimum value for maxTimeSeconds is 600 (10 minutes) and its maximum value is 86,400 (24 hours).)
    ///   - priority: The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the priority parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a priority value of 10 is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of 1. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can't be mixed.
    ///   - schedulingPolicyArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the fair-share scheduling policy. Job queues that don't have a fair-share scheduling policy are scheduled in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) model.  After a job queue has a fair-share scheduling policy, it can be replaced but can't be removed. The format is aws:Partition:batch:Region:Account:scheduling-policy/Name . An example is aws:aws:batch:us-west-2:123456789012:scheduling-policy/MySchedulingPolicy. A job queue without a fair-share scheduling policy is scheduled as a FIFO job queue and can't have a fair-share scheduling policy added. Jobs queues with a fair-share scheduling policy can have a maximum of 500 active share identifiers. When the limit has been reached, submissions of any jobs that add a new share identifier fail.
    ///   - state: The state of the job queue. If the job queue state is ENABLED, it is able to accept jobs. If the job queue state is DISABLED, new jobs can't be added to the queue, but jobs already in the queue can finish.

The filter doesn't apply to child jobs in an array or multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. The results are sorted by the createdAt field, with the most recent jobs being first.  JOB_NAME  The value of the filter is a case-insensitive match for the job name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter matches any job name that begins with the string before the '*'. This corresponds to the jobName value. For example, test1 matches both Test1 and test1, and test1* matches both test1 and Test10. When the JOB_NAME filter is used, the results are grouped by the job name and version.  JOB_DEFINITION  The value for the filter is the name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job definition. This corresponds to the jobDefinition value. The value is case sensitive. When the value for the filter is the job definition name, the results include all the jobs that used any revision of that job definition name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter matches any job definition name that begins with the string before the '*'. For example, jd1 matches only jd1, and jd1* matches both jd1 and jd1A. The version of the job definition that's used doesn't affect the sort order. When the JOB_DEFINITION filter is used and the ARN is used (which is in the form arn:${Partition}:batch:${Region}:${Account}:job-definition/${JobDefinitionName}:${Revision}), the results include jobs that used the specified revision of the job definition. Asterisk (*) isn't supported when the ARN is used.  BEFORE_CREATED_AT  The value for the filter is the time that's before the job was created. This corresponds to the createdAt value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.  AFTER_CREATED_AT  The value for the filter is the time that's after the job was created. This corresponds to the createdAt value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.

Likewise, if the compute environment has a regular IAM role, it can't be changed to use a service-linked role. To update the parameters for the compute environment that require an infrastructure update to change, the AWSServiceRoleForBatch service-linked role must be used. For more information, see Updating compute environments in the Batch User Guide.  If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.  Depending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the service-role path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.
    ///   - state: The state of the compute environment. Compute environments in the ENABLED state can accept jobs from a queue and scale in or out automatically based on the workload demand of its associated queues. If the state is ENABLED, then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand. If the state is DISABLED, then the Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a STARTING or RUNNING state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the DISABLED state don't scale out.   Compute environments in a DISABLED state may continue to incur billing charges. To prevent additional charges, turn off and then delete the compute environment. For more information, see State in the Batch User Guide.  When an instance is idle, the instance scales down to the minvCpus value. However, the instance size doesn't change. For example, consider a c5.8xlarge instance with a minvCpus value of 4 and a desiredvCpus value of 36. This instance doesn't scale down to a c5.large instance.

    ///   - filters: The filter to apply to the query. Only one filter can be used at a time. When the filter is used, jobStatus is ignored. The filter doesn't apply to child jobs in an array or multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. The results are sorted by the createdAt field, with the most recent jobs being first.  JOB_NAME  The value of the filter is a case-insensitive match for the job name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter matches any job name that begins with the string before the '*'. This corresponds to the jobName value. For example, test1 matches both Test1 and test1, and test1* matches both test1 and Test10. When the JOB_NAME filter is used, the results are grouped by the job name and version.  JOB_DEFINITION  The value for the filter is the name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job definition. This corresponds to the jobDefinition value. The value is case sensitive. When the value for the filter is the job definition name, the results include all the jobs that used any revision of that job definition name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter matches any job definition name that begins with the string before the '*'. For example, jd1 matches only jd1, and jd1* matches both jd1 and jd1A. The version of the job definition that's used doesn't affect the sort order. When the JOB_DEFINITION filter is used and the ARN is used (which is in the form arn:${Partition}:batch:${Region}:${Account}:job-definition/${JobDefinitionName}:${Revision}), the results include jobs that used the specified revision of the job definition. Asterisk (*) isn't supported when the ARN is used.  BEFORE_CREATED_AT  The value for the filter is the time that's before the job was created. This corresponds to the createdAt value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.  AFTER_CREATED_AT  The value for the filter is the time that's after the job was created. This corresponds to the createdAt value. The value is a string representation of the number of milliseconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.
    ///   - jobQueue: The name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job queue used to list jobs.
    ///   - jobStatus: The job status used to filter jobs in the specified queue. If the filters parameter is specified, the jobStatus parameter is ignored and jobs with any status are returned. If you don't specify a status, only RUNNING jobs are returned.
    ///   - maxResults: The maximum number of results returned by ListJobs in a paginated output. When this parameter is used, ListJobs returns up to maxResults results in a single page and a nextToken response element, if applicable. The remaining results of the initial request can be seen by sending another ListJobs request with the returned nextToken value.

When --filters is used, Batch returns up to 100 values.
