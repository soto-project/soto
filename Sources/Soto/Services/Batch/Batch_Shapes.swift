This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.   BEST_FIT (default)  AWS Batch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren't available, AWS Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren't enough instances available, or if the user is hitting Amazon EC2 service limits then additional jobs aren't run until the currently running jobs have completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with BEST_FIT then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified.  BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE  AWS Batch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren't available, AWS Batch will select new instance types.  SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED  AWS Batch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.

This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.   When you create a compute environment, the instance types that you select for the compute environment must share the same architecture.

If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must specify either the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name bar has a path of /foo/ then you would specify /foo/bar as the role name. For more information, see Friendly names and paths in the IAM User Guide.  Depending on how you created your AWS Batch service role, its ARN might contain the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, AWS Batch assumes that your ARN doesn't use the service-role path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.

If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand. If the state is DISABLED, then the AWS Batch scheduler doesn't attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a STARTING or RUNNING state continue to progress normally.
