/// Service object for interacting with AWS InternetMonitor service.
///
/// Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how internet issues impact the performance and availability
/// 			between your applications hosted on Amazon Web Services and your end users. It reduces the time it takes for you to diagnose
/// 			internet issues from days to minutes. Internet Monitor uses the connectivity data that Amazon Web Services captures from its global
/// 			networking footprint to calculate a baseline of performance and availability for internet traffic. This
/// 			is the same data that Amazon Web Services uses to monitor internet uptime and availability. With those measurements
/// 			as a baseline, Internet Monitor raises awareness for you when there are significant problems for your
/// 			end users in the different geographic locations where your application runs. Internet Monitor publishes internet measurements to CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Metrics,
/// 			to easily support using CloudWatch tools with health information for geographies and networks specific to your application.
/// 			Internet Monitor sends health events to Amazon EventBridge so that you can set up notifications. If an issue is caused by the Amazon Web Services network,
/// 			you also automatically receive an Amazon Web Services Health Dashboard notification with the steps that Amazon Web Services is taking to mitigate the problem. To use Internet Monitor, you create a monitor and associate your application's resources
/// 			with it, VPCs, CloudFront distributions, or WorkSpaces directories, to enable Internet Monitor to know
/// 			where your application's internet traffic is. Internet Monitor then provides internet measurements from Amazon Web Services that are specific to
/// 			the locations and networks that communicate with your application. For more information, see Using Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
