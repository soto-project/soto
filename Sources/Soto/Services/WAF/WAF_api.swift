The RateBasedRule also contains the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the RateLimit. If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule, a request not only must exceed the RateLimit, but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a RateBasedRule:   An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32    A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header   Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes.

For example, you can create a RegexMatchSet that contains a RegexMatchTuple that looks for any requests with User-Agent headers  that match a RegexPatternSet with pattern B[a@]dB[o0]t. You can then configure AWS WAF to reject those requests.

AWS WAF supports IPv4 address ranges: /8 and any range between /16 through /32. AWS WAF supports IPv6 address ranges: /24, /32, /48, /56, /64, and /128. For more information about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing. IPv6 addresses can be represented using any of the following formats:   1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128   1111:0:0:0:0:0:0:0111/128   1111::0111/128   1111::111/128   You use an IPSet to specify which web requests you want to allow or block based on the IP addresses that the requests originated from. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from one or a small number of IP addresses and you want to block the requests, you can create an IPSet that specifies those IP addresses, and then configure AWS WAF to block the requests.  To create and configure an IPSet, perform the following steps:   Submit a CreateIPSet request.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateIPSet request.   Submit an UpdateIPSet request to specify the IP addresses that you want AWS WAF to watch for.   When you update an IPSet, you specify the IP addresses that you want to add and/or the IP addresses that you want to delete. If you want to change an IP address, you delete the existing IP address and add the new one. You can insert a maximum of 1000 addresses in a single request.

AWS WAF supports IPv4 address ranges: /8 and any range between /16 through /32. AWS WAF supports IPv6 address ranges: /24, /32, /48, /56, /64, and /128. For more information about CIDR notation, see the Wikipedia entry Classless Inter-Domain Routing. IPv6 addresses can be represented using any of the following formats:   1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128   1111:0:0:0:0:0:0:0111/128   1111::0111/128   1111::111/128   You use an IPSet to specify which web requests you want to allow or block based on the IP addresses that the requests originated from. For example, if you're receiving a lot of requests from one or a small number of IP addresses and you want to block the requests, you can create an IPSet that specifies those IP addresses, and then configure AWS WAF to block the requests.  To create and configure an IPSet, perform the following steps:   Submit a CreateIPSet request.   Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateIPSet request.   Submit an UpdateIPSet request to specify the IP addresses that you want AWS WAF to watch for.   When you update an IPSet, you specify the IP addresses that you want to add and/or the IP addresses that you want to delete. If you want to change an IP address, you delete the existing IP address and add the new one. You can insert a maximum of 1000 addresses in a single request. For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide.

For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   Inserts or deletes Predicate objects in a rule and updates the RateLimit in the rule.  Each Predicate object identifies a predicate, such as a ByteMatchSet or an IPSet, that specifies the web requests that you want to block or count. The RateLimit specifies the number of requests every five minutes that triggers the rule. If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule, a request must match all the predicates and exceed the RateLimit to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a RateBasedRule:   An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32    A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header   Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests that satisfy the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. Further, requests that match these two conditions much be received at a rate of more than 1,000 every five minutes. If the rate drops below this limit, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests.
