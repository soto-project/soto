Valid values for Action include the following:    ALLOW: CloudFront responds with the requested object.    BLOCK: CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.    COUNT: AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the rule and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.     ActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL. In this case, you do not use ActivatedRule|Action. For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction.
        public let action: WafAction?
        /// An array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup. Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL. Specifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it changes the action for the rules to COUNT. Therefore, requests that match an ExcludedRule are counted but not blocked. The RuleGroup owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule. If you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:   Use the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more information about the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information.   Submit an UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:   The first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the UpdateWebACL request, the first Updates:Action should be DELETE and Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that contains the rules that you want to exclude.   The second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second Updates:Action should be INSERT, Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that you just removed, and ExcludedRules should contain the rules that you want to exclude.
        public let excludedRules: [ExcludedRule]?
        /// Use the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup. Any rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request. If you set the OverrideAction to None, the RuleGroup will block a request if any individual rule in the RuleGroup matches the request and is configured to block that request. However if you first want to test the RuleGroup, set the OverrideAction to Count. The RuleGroup will then override any block action specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using GetSampledRequests.   ActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL. In this case you do not use ActivatedRule|Action. For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction.

CONTAINS_WORD  The specified part of the web request must include the value of TargetString, and TargetString must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, TargetString must be a word, which means one of the following:    TargetString exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request, such as the value of a header.    TargetString is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, BadBot;.

Valid values depend on the values that you specified for FieldToMatch:    HEADER: The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that you specified in FieldToMatch, for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header.    METHOD: The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the request. CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, and PUT.    QUERY_STRING: The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character.    URI: The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg.    BODY: The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see CreateSizeConstraintSet.     SINGLE_QUERY_ARG: The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion. The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.    ALL_QUERY_ARGS: Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG, but instead of inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString.   If TargetString includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.  If you're using the AWS WAF API  Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes. For example, suppose the value of Type is HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent. If you want to search the User-Agent header for the value BadBot, you base64-encode BadBot using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, QmFkQm90, in the value of TargetString.  If you're using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs  The value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.

If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data.    METHOD: The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, and PUT.    QUERY_STRING: A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.    URI: The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg.    BODY: The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see CreateSizeConstraintSet.

ALL_QUERY_ARGS: Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG, but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString.
