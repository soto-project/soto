///    Amazon Connect actions     Amazon Connect data types    Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that you use to set up and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer engagement at any scale. Amazon Connect provides metrics and real-time reporting that enable you to optimize contact routing. You can also resolve customer issues more efficiently by getting customers in touch with the appropriate agents. There are limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can create. There are also limits to the number of requests that you can make per second. For more information, see Amazon Connect Service Quotas in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. You can use an endpoint to connect programmatically to an Amazon Web Services service. For a list of Amazon Connect endpoints, see Amazon Connect Endpoints.

ENTIRE_PAST_SESSION: Rehydrates a chat from the most recently terminated past chat contact of the specified past ended chat session. To use this type, provide the initialContactId of the past ended chat session in the sourceContactId field. In this type, Amazon Connect determines what the most recent chat contact on the past ended chat session and uses it to start a persistent chat.     FROM_SEGMENT: Rehydrates a chat from the specified past chat contact provided in the sourceContactId field.    The actual contactId used for rehydration is provided in the response of this API. To illustrate how to use rehydration type, consider the following example: A customer starts a chat session. Agent a1 accepts the chat and a conversation starts between the customer and Agent a1. This first contact creates a contact ID C1. Agent a1 then transfers the chat to Agent a2. This creates another contact ID C2. At this point Agent a2 ends the chat. The customer is forwarded to the disconnect flow for a post chat survey that creates another contact ID C3. After the chat survey, the chat session ends. Later, the customer returns and wants to resume their past chat session. At this point, the customer can have following use cases:     Use Case 1: The customer wants to continue the past chat session but they want to hide the post chat survey. For this they will use the following configuration:    Configuration    SourceContactId = "C2"   RehydrationType = "FROM_SEGMENT"      Expected behavior    This starts a persistent chat session from the specified past ended contact (C2). Transcripts of past chat sessions C2 and C1 are accessible in the current persistent chat session. Note that chat segment C3 is dropped from the persistent chat session.        Use Case 2: The customer wants to continue the past chat session and see the transcript of the entire past engagement, including the post chat survey. For this they will use the following configuration:    Configuration    SourceContactId = "C1"   RehydrationType = "ENTIRE_PAST_SESSION"      Expected behavior    This starts a persistent chat session from the most recently ended chat contact (C3). Transcripts of past chat sessions C3, C2 and C1 are accessible in the current persistent chat session.

You can also update attributes for a contact using data from your CRM application and save the data with the contact in Amazon Connect. You could also flag calls for additional analysis, such as legal review or to identify abusive callers. Contact attributes are available in Amazon Connect for 24 months, and are then deleted. For information about contact record retention and the maximum size of the contact record attributes section, see Feature specifications in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.
    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - attributes: The Amazon Connect attributes. These attributes can be accessed in flows just like any other contact attributes. You can have up to 32,768 UTF-8 bytes across all attributes for a contact. Attribute keys can include only alphanumeric, dash, and underscore characters. In the Set contact attributes block, when the attributes for a contact exceed 32 KB, the contact is routed down the Error branch of the flow. As a mitigation, consider the following options:   Remove unnecessary attributes by setting their values to empty.   If the attributes are only used in one flow and don't need to be referred to outside of that flow (for example, by a Lambda or another flow), then use flow attributes. This way you aren't needlessly persisting the 32 KB of information from one flow to another. For more information, see Flow block: Set contact attributes in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide.

When the filter RoutingStepExpression is used, this metric is still calculated from enqueue time.
