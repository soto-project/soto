/// Service object for interacting with AWS Connect service.

///    Amazon Connect actions     Amazon Connect data types    Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that you use to set up and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer engagement at any scale. Amazon Connect provides metrics and real-time reporting that enable you to optimize contact routing. You can also resolve customer issues more efficiently by getting customers in touch with the appropriate agents. There are limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can create. There are also limits to the number of requests that you can make per second. For more information, see Amazon Connect Service Quotas in the Amazon Connect Administrator Guide. You can use an endpoint to connect programmatically to an Amazon Web Services service. For a list of Amazon Connect endpoints, see Amazon Connect Endpoints.

ENTIRE_PAST_SESSION: Rehydrates a chat from the most recently terminated past chat contact of the specified past ended chat session. To use this type, provide the initialContactId of the past ended chat session in the sourceContactId field. In this type, Amazon Connect determines what the most recent chat contact on the past ended chat session and uses it to start a persistent chat.     FROM_SEGMENT: Rehydrates a chat from the specified past chat contact provided in the sourceContactId field.    The actual contactId used for rehydration is provided in the response of this API. To illustrate how to use rehydration type, consider the following example: A customer starts a chat session. Agent a1 accepts the chat and a conversation starts between the customer and Agent a1. This first contact creates a contact ID C1. Agent a1 then transfers the chat to Agent a2. This creates another contact ID C2. At this point Agent a2 ends the chat. The customer is forwarded to the disconnect flow for a post chat survey that creates another contact ID C3. After the chat survey, the chat session ends. Later, the customer returns and wants to resume their past chat session. At this point, the customer can have following use cases:     Use Case 1: The customer wants to continue the past chat session but they want to hide the post chat survey. For this they will use the following configuration:    Configuration    SourceContactId = "C2"   RehydrationType = "FROM_SEGMENT"      Expected behavior    This starts a persistent chat session from the specified past ended contact (C2). Transcripts of past chat sessions C2 and C1 are accessible in the current persistent chat session. Note that chat segment C3 is dropped from the persistent chat session.        Use Case 2: The customer wants to continue the past chat session and see the transcript of the entire past engagement, including the post chat survey. For this they will use the following configuration:    Configuration    SourceContactId = "C1"   RehydrationType = "ENTIRE_PAST_SESSION"      Expected behavior    This starts a persistent chat session from the most recently ended chat contact (C3). Transcripts of past chat sessions C3, C2 and C1 are accessible in the current persistent chat session.

After disassociation, emails sent to the former alias email address are no longer forwarded to the primary email address. Both email addresses continue to exist independently and can receive emails directly.  Use cases  Following are common uses cases for this API:    Department separation: Remove alias relationships when splitting a consolidated support queue back into separate department-specific queues.    Email address retirement: Cleanly remove forwarding relationships before decommissioning old email addresses.    Organizational restructuring: Reconfigure email routing when business processes change and aliases are no longer needed.    Important things to know    Concurrent operations: This API uses distributed locking, so concurrent operations on the same email addresses may be temporarily blocked.   Emails sent to the former alias address are still delivered directly to that address if it exists.   You do not need to delete the email addresses after disassociation. Both addresses remain active independently.   After a successful disassociation, you can immediately create a new alias relationship with the same addresses.   200 status means alias was successfully disassociated.    DisassociateEmailAddressAlias does not return the following information:   Details in the response about the email that was disassociated. The response returns an empty body.   The timestamp of when the disassociation occurred.    Endpoints: See Amazon Connect endpoints and quotas.  Related operations     AssociateEmailAddressAlias: Associates an email address alias with an existing email address in an Amazon Connect instance.    DescribeEmailAddress: View current alias configurations for an email address.    SearchEmailAddresses: Find email addresses and their alias relationships across an instance.    CreateEmailAddress: Create new email addresses that can participate in alias relationships.    DeleteEmailAddress: Remove email addresses (automatically removes any alias relationships).

Its similar to sorting items into buckets based on a common characteristic, then counting or calculating something for each bucket. For example, when grouped by QUEUE, the metrics returned apply to each queue rather than aggregated for all queues.  The grouping list is an ordered list, with the first item in the list defined as the primary grouping. If no grouping is included in the request, the aggregation happens at the instance-level.   If you group by CHANNEL, you should include a Channels filter. VOICE, CHAT, and TASK channels are supported.   If you group by AGENT_STATUS, you must include the QUEUE as the primary grouping and use queue filter. When you group by AGENT_STATUS, the only metric available is the AGENTS_ONLINE metric.   If you group by ROUTING_PROFILE, you must include either a queue or routing profile filter. In addition, a routing profile filter is required for metrics CONTACTS_SCHEDULED, CONTACTS_IN_QUEUE, and  OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE.   When using the RoutingStepExpression filter, group by ROUTING_STEP_EXPRESSION is required.

Response of this API provides a token required to obtain credentials from the CreateParticipantConnection API in the Amazon Connect Participant Service. When a new chat contact is successfully created, clients must subscribe to the participant’s connection for the created chat within 5 minutes. This is achieved by invoking CreateParticipantConnection with WEBSOCKET and CONNECTION_CREDENTIALS.  A 429 error occurs in the following situations:   API rate limit is exceeded. API TPS throttling returns a TooManyRequests exception.   The quota for concurrent active chats is exceeded. Active chat throttling returns a LimitExceededException.

When you do not use groupings, Unit says SECONDS but the Value is returned in MILLISECONDS. For example, if you get a response like this:  { "Metric": { "Name": "OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE", "Unit": "SECONDS" }, "Value": 24113.0 } The actual OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE is 24 seconds. When the filter RoutingStepExpression is used, this metric is still calculated from enqueue time.

RoutingStepExpressions: 50   AgentStatuses: 50   Metric data is retrieved only for the resources associated with the queues or routing profiles, and by any channels included in the filter. (You cannot filter by both queue AND routing profile.) You can include both resource IDs and resource ARNs in the same request. When using AgentStatuses as filter make sure Queues is added as primary filter. When using the RoutingStepExpression filter, you need to pass exactly one QueueId.

Currently tagging is only supported on the resources that are passed in the filter.
    ///   - groupings: Defines the level of aggregation for metrics data by a dimension(s). Its similar to sorting items into buckets based on a common characteristic, then counting or calculating something for each bucket. For example, when grouped by QUEUE, the metrics returned apply to each queue rather than aggregated for all queues.  The grouping list is an ordered list, with the first item in the list defined as the primary grouping. If no grouping is included in the request, the aggregation happens at the instance-level.   If you group by CHANNEL, you should include a Channels filter. VOICE, CHAT, and TASK channels are supported.   If you group by AGENT_STATUS, you must include the QUEUE as the primary grouping and use queue filter. When you group by AGENT_STATUS, the only metric available is the AGENTS_ONLINE metric.   If you group by ROUTING_PROFILE, you must include either a queue or routing profile filter. In addition, a routing profile filter is required for metrics CONTACTS_SCHEDULED, CONTACTS_IN_QUEUE, and  OLDEST_CONTACT_AGE.   When using the RoutingStepExpression filter, group by ROUTING_STEP_EXPRESSION is required.
