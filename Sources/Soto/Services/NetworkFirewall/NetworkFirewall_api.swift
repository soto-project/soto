/// Service object for interacting with AWS NetworkFirewall service.
///
/// This is the API Reference for Network Firewall. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Network Firewall API actions, data types, and errors.  The REST API requires you to handle connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. For general information about using the Amazon Web Services REST APIs, see Amazon Web Services APIs.  To view the complete list of Amazon Web Services Regions where Network Firewall is available, see Service endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.  To access Network Firewall using the IPv4 REST API endpoint: https://network-firewall..amazonaws.com   To access Network Firewall using the Dualstack (IPv4 and IPv6) REST API endpoint: https://network-firewall..aws.api   Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs. For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and step-by-step instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall console, see the Network Firewall Developer Guide. Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules that are compatible with Suricata, a free, open source network analysis and threat detection engine. Network Firewall supports Suricata version 7.0.3. For information about Suricata, see the Suricata website and the  Suricata User Guide.  You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of ways. The following are just a few examples:    Allow domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service endpoints, such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic.   Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your applications can access.   Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.   Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, regardless of the port used.   To enable Network Firewall for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in Network Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see Amazon VPC User Guide. To start using Network Firewall, do the following:    (Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to protect, create it in Amazon VPC.    In Amazon VPC, in each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall endpoint, create a subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall.    In Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define the components of the network traffic filtering behavior that you want your firewall to have.    In Network Firewall, create a firewall policy that uses your rule groups and specifies additional default traffic filtering behavior.    In Network Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy and VPC subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet that you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy.   In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route traffic through the new firewall endpoints.

You can't change or exceed this capacity when you update the rule group, so leave room for your rule group to grow.    Capacity for a stateless rule group  For a stateless rule group, the capacity required is the sum of the capacity requirements of the individual rules that you expect to have in the rule group.

A source setting ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"] has a value of 3.    A rule with no criteria specified in any of its match settings has a capacity requirement of 1. A rule with protocol setting ["UDP","TCP"], source setting ["10.0.0.0/24","10.0.0.1/24","10.0.0.2/24"], and a single specification or no specification for each of the other match settings has a capacity requirement of 6.
