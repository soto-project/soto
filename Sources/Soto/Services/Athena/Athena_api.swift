/// Service object for interacting with AWS Athena service.
///
/// Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that lets you use standard SQL to analyze data directly in Amazon S3. You can point Athena at your data in Amazon S3 and run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to set up or manage. You pay only for the queries you run. Athena scales automatically—executing queries in parallel—so results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries. For more information, see What is Amazon Athena in the Amazon Athena User Guide. If you connect to Athena using the JDBC driver, use version 1.1.0 of the driver or later with the Amazon Athena API. Earlier version drivers do not support the API. For more information and to download the driver, see Accessing Amazon Athena with JDBC.

The catalog name must be unique for the Amazon Web Services account and can use a maximum of 127 alphanumeric, underscore, at sign, or hyphen characters. The remainder of the length constraint of 256 is reserved for use by Athena. For FEDERATED type the catalog name has following considerations and limits:   The catalog name allows special characters such as _ , @ , \ , - . These characters are replaced with a hyphen (-) when creating the CFN Stack Name and with an underscore (_) when creating the Lambda Function and Glue Connection Name.   The catalog name has a theoretical limit of 128 characters.

The sdk-version parameter is optional and defaults to the currently supported version.  metadata-function=lambda_arn, sdk-version=version_number     For the LAMBDA data catalog type, use one of the following sets of required parameters, but not both.   If you have one Lambda function that processes metadata and another for reading the actual data, use the following syntax. Both parameters are required.  metadata-function=lambda_arn, record-function=lambda_arn     If you have a composite Lambda function that processes both metadata and data, use the following syntax to specify your Lambda function.  function=lambda_arn       The GLUE type takes a catalog ID parameter and is required. The  catalog_id is the account ID of the Amazon Web Services account to which the Glue Data Catalog belongs.  catalog-id=catalog_id     The GLUE data catalog type also applies to the default AwsDataCatalog that already exists in your account, of which you can have only one and cannot modify.     The FEDERATED data catalog type uses one of the following parameters, but not both. Use connection-arn for an existing Glue connection. Use connection-type and connection-properties to specify the configuration setting for a new connection.    connection-arn:      lambda-role-arn (optional): The execution role to use for the Lambda function. If not provided, one is created.    connection-type:MYSQL|REDSHIFT|...., connection-properties:""  For   , use escaped JSON text, as in the following example.
