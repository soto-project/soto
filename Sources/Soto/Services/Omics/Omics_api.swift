    ///   - logLevel: A log level for the run.
    ///   - name: A name for the run. This is recommended to view and organize runs in the Amazon Web Services HealthOmics console and CloudWatch logs.
    ///   - outputUri: An output S3 URI for the run. The S3 bucket must be in the same region as the workflow. The role ARN must have permission to write to this S3 bucket.
    ///   - parameters: Parameters for the run. The run needs all required parameters and can include optional parameters. The run cannot include any parameters that are not defined in the parameter template. To retrieve parameters from the run, use the GetRun API operation.
    ///   - priority: Use the run priority (highest: 1) to establish the order of runs in a run group when you start a run. If multiple runs share the same priority, the run that was initiated first will have the higher priority. Runs that do not belong to a run group can be assigned a priority. The priorities of these runs are ranked among other runs that are not in a run group. For more information, see Run priority in the Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide.
    ///   - requestId: An idempotency token used to dedupe retry requests so that duplicate runs are not created.
    ///   - retentionMode: The retention mode for the run. The default value is RETAIN.  Amazon Web Services HealthOmics stores a fixed number of runs that are available to the console and API. In the default mode (RETAIN), you need to remove runs manually when the number of run exceeds the maximum. If you set the retention mode to REMOVE, Amazon Web Services HealthOmics automatically removes runs (that have mode set to REMOVE) when the number of run exceeds the maximum. All run logs are available in CloudWatch logs, if you need information about a run that is no longer available to the API. For more information about retention mode, see Specifying run retention mode in the Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide.

An example roleArn is arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/omics-service-role-serviceRole-W8O1XMPL7QZ. In this example, the AWS account ID is 123456789012 and the role name is omics-service-role-serviceRole-W8O1XMPL7QZ.
    ///   - runGroupId: The run's group ID. Use a run group to cap the compute resources (and number of concurrent runs) for the runs that you add to the run group.

If your requested storage capacity is unavailable, the system rounds up the value to the nearest 1200 GiB multiple. If the requested storage capacity is still unavailable, the system rounds up the value to the nearest 2400 GiB multiple. This field is not required if the storage type is DYNAMIC (the system ignores any value that you enter).
    ///   - storageType: The storage type for the run. If you set the storage type to DYNAMIC, Amazon Web Services HealthOmics dynamically scales the storage up or down, based on file system utilization. By default, the run uses STATIC storage type, which allocates a fixed amount of storage. For more information about DYNAMIC and STATIC storage, see Run storage types in the Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide.
    ///   - tags: Tags for the run. You can add up to 50 tags per run. For more information, see Adding a tag in the Amazon Web Services HealthOmics User Guide.
    ///   - workflowId: The run's workflow ID. The workflowId is not the UUID.
    ///   - workflowOwnerId: The 12-digit account ID of the workflow owner that is used for running a shared workflow. The workflow owner ID can be retrieved using the GetShare API operation. If you are the workflow owner, you do not need to include this ID.
    ///   - workflowType: The run's workflow type. The workflowType must be specified if you are running a READY2RUN workflow. If you are running a PRIVATE workflow (default), you do not need to include the workflow type.
    ///   - workflowVersionName: The name of the workflow version. Use workflow versions to track and organize changes to the workflow.
