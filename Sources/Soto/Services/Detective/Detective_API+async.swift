    /// Creates a new behavior graph for the calling account, and sets that account as the administrator account. This operation is called by the account that is enabling Detective. Before you try to enable Detective, make sure that your account has been enrolled in Amazon GuardDuty for at least 48 hours. If you do not meet this requirement, you cannot enable Detective. If you do meet the GuardDuty prerequisite, then when you make the request to enable Detective, it checks whether your data volume is within the Detective quota. If it exceeds the quota, then you cannot enable Detective.  The operation also enables Detective for the calling account in the currently selected Region. It returns the ARN of the new behavior graph.  CreateGraph triggers a process to create the corresponding data tables for the new behavior graph. An account can only be the administrator account for one behavior graph within a Region. If the same account calls CreateGraph with the same administrator account, it always returns the same behavior graph ARN. It does not create a new behavior graph.

This would be used when the administrator manages their member accounts centrally. The request provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to invite. The response separates the requested accounts into two lists:   The accounts that CreateMembers was able to start the verification for. This list includes member accounts that are being verified, that have passed verification and are to be invited, and that have failed verification.   The accounts that CreateMembers was unable to process. This list includes accounts that were already invited to be member accounts in the behavior graph.
