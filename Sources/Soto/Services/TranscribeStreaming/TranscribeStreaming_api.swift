/// Service object for interacting with AWS TranscribeStreaming service.
///
/// Amazon Transcribe streaming offers three main types of real-time transcription:  Standard, Medical, and  Call Analytics.    Standard transcriptions are the most common option. Refer to  for details.    Medical transcriptions are tailored to medical professionals  and incorporate medical terms. A common use case for this service is transcribing doctor-patient  dialogue in real time, so doctors can focus on their patient instead of taking notes. Refer to for details.    Call Analytics transcriptions are designed for use with call center audio on two different channels; if you're looking for insight into customer service calls, use this  option. Refer to  for details.
