/// Service object for interacting with AWS TranscribeStreaming service.

/// Amazon Transcribe streaming offers two types of real-time transcription:  Standard and Medical.    Standard transcriptions are the most common option. Refer to  for details.     Medical transcriptions are tailored to medical professionals  and incorporate medical terms. A common use case for this service is transcribing doctor-patient  dialogue in real time, so doctors can focus on their patient instead of taking notes. Refer to for details.
