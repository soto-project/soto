/// AWS Key Management Service AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide .  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS. Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.  Signing Requests  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests. All AWS KMS operations require Signature Version 4.  Logging API Requests  AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.  Additional Resources  For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:    AWS Security Credentials - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used for accessing AWS.    Temporary Security Credentials - This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.    Signature Version 4 Signing Process - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.    Commonly Used API Operations  Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.    Encrypt     Decrypt     GenerateDataKey     GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext

For more information about scheduling and canceling deletion of a CMK, see Deleting Customer Master Keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key state: Effect on your CMK in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account.  Required permissions: kms:CancelKeyDeletion (key policy)  Related operations: ScheduleKeyDeletion

    /// Connects or reconnects a custom key store to its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. The custom key store must be connected before you can create customer master keys (CMKs) in the key store or use the CMKs it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time. To connect a custom key store, its associated AWS CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the CreateHsm operation. Also, the  kmsuser crypto user (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents AWS KMS from using this account to log in. The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. During the connection process, AWS KMS finds the AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the AWS CloudHSM client as the kmsuser CU, and rotates its password. The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the ConnectionErrorCode in the response. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry. To fix the failure, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use ConnectCustomKeyStore again. If you are having trouble connecting or disconnecting a custom key store, see Troubleshooting a Custom Key Store in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

    /// Creates a friendly name for a customer master key (CMK).   Adding, deleting, or updating an alias can allow or deny permission to the CMK. For details, see Using ABAC in AWS KMS in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.  You can use an alias to identify a CMK in the AWS KMS console, in the DescribeKey operation and in cryptographic operations, such as Encrypt and GenerateDataKey. You can also change the CMK that's associated with the alias (UpdateAlias) or delete the alias (DeleteAlias) at any time. These operations don't affect the underlying CMK.  You can associate the alias with any customer managed CMK in the same AWS Region. Each alias is associated with only one CMK at a time, but a CMK can have multiple aliases. A valid CMK is required. You can't create an alias without a CMK. The alias must be unique in the account and Region, but you can have aliases with the same name in different Regions. For detailed information about aliases, see Using aliases in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. This operation does not return a response. To get the alias that you created, use the ListAliases operation. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state.

This operation is part of the Custom Key Store feature feature in AWS KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of AWS KMS with the isolation and control of a single-tenant key store. Before you create the custom key store, you must assemble the required elements, including an AWS CloudHSM cluster that fulfills the requirements for a custom key store. For details about the required elements, see Assemble the Prerequisites in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. When the operation completes successfully, it returns the ID of the new custom key store. Before you can use your new custom key store, you need to use the ConnectCustomKeyStore operation to connect the new key store to its AWS CloudHSM cluster. Even if you are not going to use your custom key store immediately, you might want to connect it to verify that all settings are correct and then disconnect it until you are ready to use it.

    /// Adds a grant to a customer master key (CMK).  A grant is a policy instrument that allows AWS principals to use AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) in cryptographic operations. It also can allow them to view a CMK (DescribeKey) and create and manage grants. When authorizing access to a CMK, grants are considered along with key policies and IAM policies. Grants are often used for temporary permissions because you can create one, use its permissions, and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies.  For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see Using grants in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . For examples of working with grants in several programming languages, see Programming grants. The CreateGrant operation returns a GrantToken and a GrantId.   When you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief delay, usually less than five minutes, until the grant is available throughout AWS KMS. This state is known as eventual consistency. Once the grant has achieved eventual consistency, the grantee principal can use the permissions in the grant without identifying the grant.  However, to use the permissions in the grant immediately, use the GrantToken that CreateGrant returns. For details, see Using a grant token in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide .   The CreateGrant operation also returns a GrantId. You can use the GrantId and a key identifier to identify the grant in the RetireGrant and RevokeGrant operations. To find the grant ID, use the ListGrants or ListRetirableGrants operations.   For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. For more information about grants, see Grants in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key state: Effect on your CMK in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.

    }

    /// Creates a unique customer managed customer master key (CMK) in your AWS account and Region. You can use the CreateKey operation to create symmetric or asymmetric CMKs.    Symmetric CMKs contain a 256-bit symmetric key that never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. To use the CMK, you must call AWS KMS. You can use a symmetric CMK to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they are typically used to generate data keys and data keys pairs. For details, see GenerateDataKey and GenerateDataKeyPair.    Asymmetric CMKs can contain an RSA key pair or an Elliptic Curve (ECC) key pair. The private key in an asymmetric CMK never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key so it can be used outside of AWS KMS. CMKs with RSA key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but not both). CMKs with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and verify messages.   For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. To create different types of CMKs, use the following guidance:  Asymmetric CMKs  To create an asymmetric CMK, use the CustomerMasterKeySpec parameter to specify the type of key material in the CMK. Then, use the KeyUsage parameter to determine whether the CMK will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change these properties after the CMK is created.    Symmetric CMKs  When creating a symmetric CMK, you don't need to specify the CustomerMasterKeySpec or KeyUsage parameters. The default value for CustomerMasterKeySpec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, and the default value for KeyUsage, ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, are the only valid values for symmetric CMKs.     Multi-Region primary keys Imported key material  To create a multi-Region primary key in the local AWS Region, use the MultiRegion parameter with a value of True. To create a multi-Region replica key, that is, a CMK with the same key ID and key material as a primary key, but in a different AWS Region, use the ReplicateKey operation. To change a replica key to a primary key, and its primary key to a replica key, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion operation. This operation supports multi-Region keys, an AWS KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable CMKs in different AWS Regions. Because these CMKs have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them to encrypt data in one AWS Region and decrypt it in a different AWS Region without making a cross-Region call or exposing the plaintext data. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. You can create symmetric and asymmetric multi-Region keys and multi-Region keys with imported key material. You cannot create multi-Region keys in a custom key store.     To import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric CMK with no key material. To do this, use the Origin parameter of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL. Next, use GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and import token, and use the public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use ImportKeyMaterial with your import token to import the key material. For step-by-step instructions, see Importing Key Material in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide . You cannot import the key material into an asymmetric CMK. To create a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, use the Origin parameter of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL and the MultiRegion parameter with a value of True. To create replicas of the multi-Region primary key, use the ReplicateKey operation. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.    Custom key store  To create a symmetric CMK in a custom key store, use the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to specify the custom key store. You must also use the Origin parameter with a value of AWS_CLOUDHSM. The AWS CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the AWS Region.  You cannot create an asymmetric CMK or a multi-Region CMK in a custom key store. For information about custom key stores in AWS KMS see Using Custom Key Stores in the  AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide .    Cross-account use: No. You cannot use this operation to create a CMK in a different AWS account.  Required permissions: kms:CreateKey (IAM policy). To use the Tags parameter, kms:TagResource (IAM policy). For examples and information about related permissions, see Allow a user to create CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

    /// Decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted by a AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) using any of the following operations:    Encrypt     GenerateDataKey     GenerateDataKeyPair     GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext     GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext    You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted under a symmetric or asymmetric CMK. When the CMK is asymmetric, you must specify the CMK and the encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of AWS KMS by the public key in an AWS KMS asymmetric CMK. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, the KeyId parameter is optional. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the CMK ID. However, specifying the CMK is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the KeyId parameter to specify a CMK, AWS KMS only uses the CMK you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different CMK, the Decrypt operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the CMK that you intend. Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the Decrypt operation on a particular CMK, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user Decrypt permission on all CMKs. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by CMKs in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account CMK permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for Decrypt permissions, limit the user to particular CMKs or particular trusted accounts. For details, see Best practices for IAM policies in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key state: Effect on your CMK in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account use: Yes. You can decrypt a ciphertext using a CMK in a different AWS account.

For details, see Using ABAC in AWS KMS in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs, use the ListAliases operation.  Each CMK can have multiple aliases. To change the alias of a CMK, use DeleteAlias to delete the current alias and CreateAlias to create a new alias. To associate an existing alias with a different customer master key (CMK), call UpdateAlias.  Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account.

The custom key store that you delete cannot contain any AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs). Before deleting the key store, verify that you will never need to use any of the CMKs in the key store for any cryptographic operations. Then, use ScheduleKeyDeletion to delete the AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) from the key store. When the scheduled waiting period expires, the ScheduleKeyDeletion operation deletes the CMKs. Then it makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. After all CMKs are deleted from AWS KMS, use DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect the key store from AWS KMS. Then, you can delete the custom key store. Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect it from AWS KMS. While the key store is disconnected, you cannot create or use the CMKs in the key store. But, you do not need to delete CMKs and you can reconnect a disconnected custom key store at any time.

    /// Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customer master key (CMK). The Encrypt operation has two primary use cases:   You can encrypt small amounts of arbitrary data, such as a personal identifier or database password, or other sensitive information.    You can use the Encrypt operation to move encrypted data from one AWS Region to another. For example, in Region A, generate a data key and use the plaintext key to encrypt your data. Then, in Region A, use the Encrypt operation to encrypt the plaintext data key under a CMK in Region B. Now, you can move the encrypted data and the encrypted data key to Region B. When necessary, you can decrypt the encrypted data key and the encrypted data entirely within in Region B.   You don't need to use the Encrypt operation to encrypt a data key. The GenerateDataKey and GenerateDataKeyPair operations return a plaintext data key and an encrypted copy of that data key. When you encrypt data, you must specify a symmetric or asymmetric CMK to use in the encryption operation. The CMK must have a KeyUsage value of ENCRYPT_DECRYPT. To find the KeyUsage of a CMK, use the DescribeKey operation.  If you use a symmetric CMK, you can use an encryption context to add additional security to your encryption operation. If you specify an EncryptionContext when encrypting data, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the data. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an InvalidCiphertextException. For more information, see Encryption Context in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. If you specify an asymmetric CMK, you must also specify the encryption algorithm. The algorithm must be compatible with the CMK type.  When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails. You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.  The maximum size of the data that you can encrypt varies with the type of CMK and the encryption algorithm that you choose.

How to use your data key  We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your application. You can write your own code or use a client-side encryption library, such as the AWS Encryption SDK, the Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client, or Amazon S3 client-side encryption to do these tasks for you. To encrypt data outside of AWS KMS:   Use the GenerateDataKey operation to get a data key.   Use the plaintext data key (in the Plaintext field of the response) to encrypt your data outside of AWS KMS. Then erase the plaintext data key from memory.   Store the encrypted data key (in the CiphertextBlob field of the response) with the encrypted data.

    /// Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within AWS KMS. You can use this operation to change the customer master key (CMK) under which data is encrypted, such as when you manually rotate a CMK or change the CMK that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same CMK, such as to change the encryption context of a ciphertext. The ReEncrypt operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using an AWS KMS CMK in an AWS KMS operation, such as Encrypt or GenerateDataKey. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an asymmetric CMK outside of AWS KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS. When you use the ReEncrypt operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.   If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK, you must use the SourceKeyId parameter to identify the CMK that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.   If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, the SourceKeyId parameter is optional. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the CMK ID. However, specifying the source CMK is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the SourceKeyId parameter to specify a CMK, AWS KMS uses only the CMK you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different CMK, the ReEncrypt operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the CMK that you intend.   To reencrypt the data, you must use the DestinationKeyId parameter specify the CMK that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric CMK. If the destination CMK is an asymmetric CMK, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the CMK.  When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails. You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.    The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key state: Effect on your CMK in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account use: Yes. The source CMK and destination CMK can be in different AWS accounts. Either or both CMKs can be in a different account than the caller.  Required permissions:    kms:ReEncryptFrom permission on the source CMK (key policy)    kms:ReEncryptTo permission on the destination CMK (key policy)   To permit reencryption from or to a CMK, include the "kms:ReEncrypt*" permission in your key policy.

    /// Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This operation creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region primary key in a different Region of the same AWS partition. You can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a different Region. To create a multi-Region primary key, use the CreateKey operation. This operation supports multi-Region keys, an AWS KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable CMKs in different AWS Regions. Because these CMKs have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them to encrypt data in one AWS Region and decrypt it in a different AWS Region without making a cross-Region call or exposing the plaintext data. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. A replica key is a fully-functional CMK that can be used independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. They have the same key ID and key material. They also have the same key spec, key usage, key material origin, and automatic key rotation status. AWS KMS automatically synchronizes these shared properties among related multi-Region keys. All other properties of a replica key can differ, including its key policy, tags, aliases, and key state. AWS KMS pricing and quotas for CMKs apply to each primary key and replica key. When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key state of Creating. This key state changes to Enabled (or PendingImport) after a few seconds when the process of creating the new replica key is complete. While the key state is Creating, you can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations. If you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry on KMSInvalidStateException or call DescribeKey to check its KeyState value before using it. For details about the Creating key state, see Key state: Effect on your CMK in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The AWS CloudTrail log of a ReplicateKey operation records a ReplicateKey operation in the primary key's Region and a CreateKey operation in the replica key's Region. If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, the replica key is created with no key material. You must import the same key material that you imported into the primary key. For details, see Importing key material into multi-Region keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion operation.

    /// Schedules the deletion of a customer master key (CMK). By default, AWS KMS applies a waiting period of 30 days, but you can specify a waiting period of 7-30 days. When this operation is successful, the key state of the CMK changes to PendingDeletion and the key can't be used in any cryptographic operations. It remains in this state for the duration of the waiting period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the CMK. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the CMK, its key material, and all AWS KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.  Deleting a CMK is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a CMK is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the CMK is unrecoverable. (The only exception is a multi-Region replica key.) To prevent the use of a CMK without deleting it, use DisableKey.   If you schedule deletion of a CMK from a custom key store, when the waiting period expires, ScheduleKeyDeletion deletes the CMK from AWS KMS. Then AWS KMS makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated AWS CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its replica keys at any time. However, AWS KMS will not delete a multi-Region primary key with existing replica keys. If you schedule the deletion of a primary key with replicas, its key state changes to PendingReplicaDeletion and it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic operations. This status can continue indefinitely. When the last of its replicas keys is deleted (not just scheduled), the key state of the primary key changes to PendingDeletion and its waiting period (PendingWindowInDays) begins. For details, see Deleting multi-Region keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

To verify the signature, use the Verify operation, or use the public key in the same asymmetric CMK outside of AWS KMS. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair, such as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric customer master key (CMK). The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key to sign a message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the message was signed with that particular private key and that the message hasn't changed since it was signed.  To use the Sign operation, provide the following information:   Use the KeyId parameter to identify an asymmetric CMK with a KeyUsage value of SIGN_VERIFY. To get the KeyUsage value of a CMK, use the DescribeKey operation. The caller must have kms:Sign permission on the CMK.   Use the Message parameter to specify the message or message digest to sign. You can submit messages of up to 4096 bytes. To sign a larger message, generate a hash digest of the message, and then provide the hash digest in the Message parameter. To indicate whether the message is a full message or a digest, use the MessageType parameter.   Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the CMK.     When signing a message, be sure to record the CMK and the signing algorithm. This information is required to verify the signature.  To verify the signature that this operation generates, use the Verify operation.

For example, suppose you have a primary key in us-east-1 and a replica key in eu-west-2. If you run UpdatePrimaryRegion with a PrimaryRegion value of eu-west-2, the primary key is now the key in eu-west-2, and the key in us-east-1 becomes a replica key.

For more information about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. The primary key of a multi-Region key is the source for properties that are always shared by primary and replica keys, including the key material, key ID, key spec, key usage, key material origin, and automatic key rotation. It's the only key that can be replicated. You cannot delete the primary key until all replicas are deleted. The key ID and primary Region that you specify uniquely identify the replica key that will become the primary key. The primary Region must already have a replica key. This operation does not create a CMK in the specified Region. To find the replica keys, use the DescribeKey operation on the primary key or any replica key. To create a replica key, use the ReplicateKey operation. You can run this operation while using the affected multi-Region keys in cryptographic operations. This operation should not delay, interrupt, or cause failures in cryptographic operations.  Even after this operation completes, the process of updating the primary Region might still be in progress for a few more seconds. Operations such as DescribeKey might display both the old and new primary keys as replicas. The old and new primary keys have a transient key state of Updating. The original key state is restored when the update is complete. While the key state is Updating, you can use the keys in cryptographic operations, but you cannot replicate the new primary key or perform certain management operations, such as enabling or disabling these keys. For details about the Updating key state, see Key state: Effect on your CMK in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. This operation does not return any output. To verify that primary key is changed, use the DescribeKey operation.  Cross-account use: No. You cannot use this operation in a different AWS account.   Required permissions:     kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion on the current primary CMK (in the primary CMK's Region). Include this permission primary CMK's key policy.    kms:UpdatePrimaryRegion on the current replica CMK (in the replica CMK's Region). Include this permission in the replica CMK's key policy.

    /// Verifies a digital signature that was generated by the Sign operation.   Verification confirms that an authorized user signed the message with the specified CMK and signing algorithm, and the message hasn't changed since it was signed. If the signature is verified, the value of the SignatureValid field in the response is True. If the signature verification fails, the Verify operation fails with an KMSInvalidSignatureException exception. A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric CMK. The signature is verified by using the public key in the same asymmetric CMK. For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. To verify a digital signature, you can use the Verify operation. Specify the same asymmetric CMK, message, and signing algorithm that were used to produce the signature. You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the CMK outside of AWS KMS. Use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key in the asymmetric CMK and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of AWS KMS. The advantage of using the Verify operation is that it is performed within AWS KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is performed within the FIPS boundary, it is logged in AWS CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the CMK to verify signatures. The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details, see Key state: Effect on your CMK in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation with a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.
