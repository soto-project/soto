extension KMS {
    ///  Gets information about custom key stores in the account and Region. This operation is part of the custom key store feature feature in KMS, which
    ///  combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a
    ///  single-tenant key store. By default, this operation returns information about all custom key stores in the account and Region. To get only information about a particular custom key store, use either the CustomKeyStoreName or CustomKeyStoreId parameter (but not both). To determine whether the custom key store is connected to its CloudHSM cluster, use the ConnectionState element in the response. If an attempt to connect the custom key store failed, the ConnectionState value is FAILED and the ConnectionErrorCode element in the response indicates the cause of the failure. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry. Custom key stores have a DISCONNECTED connection state if the key store has never been connected or you use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect it. If your custom key store state is CONNECTED but you are having trouble using it, make sure that its associated CloudHSM cluster is active and contains the minimum number of HSMs required for the operation, if any. For help repairing your custom key store, see the Troubleshooting Custom Key Stores topic in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.  Cross-account use: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.  Required permissions: kms:DescribeCustomKeyStores (IAM policy)  Related operations:     ConnectCustomKeyStore     CreateCustomKeyStore     DeleteCustomKeyStore     DisconnectCustomKeyStore     UpdateCustomKeyStore

    ///  Gets a list of aliases in the caller's Amazon Web Services account and region. For more information about aliases, see CreateAlias. By default, the ListAliases operation returns all aliases in the account and region. To get only the aliases associated with a particular KMS key, use the KeyId parameter. The ListAliases response can include aliases that you created and associated with your customer managed keys, and aliases that Amazon Web Services created and associated with Amazon Web Services managed keys in your account. You can recognize Amazon Web Services aliases because their names have the format aws/, such as aws/dynamodb. The response might also include aliases that have no TargetKeyId field. These are predefined aliases that Amazon Web Services has created but has not yet associated with a KMS key. Aliases that Amazon Web Services creates in your account, including predefined aliases, do not count against your KMS aliases quota.  Cross-account use: No. ListAliases does not return aliases in other Amazon Web Services accounts.

For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see Grants in KMS in the  Key Management Service Developer Guide . For examples of working with grants in several programming languages, see Programming grants.   The GranteePrincipal field in the ListGrants response usually contains the user or role designated as the grantee principal in the grant. However, when the grantee principal in the grant is an Amazon Web Services service, the GranteePrincipal field contains the service principal, which might represent several different grantee principals.   Cross-account use: Yes. To perform this operation on a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter.
