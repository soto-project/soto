The custom key store must be connected before you can create KMS keys in the key store or use the KMS keys it contains. You can disconnect and reconnect a custom key store at any time. To connect a custom key store, its associated CloudHSM cluster must have at least one active HSM. To get the number of active HSMs in a cluster, use the DescribeClusters operation. To add HSMs to the cluster, use the CreateHsm operation. Also, the  kmsuser crypto user (CU) must not be logged into the cluster. This prevents KMS from using this account to log in. The connection process can take an extended amount of time to complete; up to 20 minutes. This operation starts the connection process, but it does not wait for it to complete. When it succeeds, this operation quickly returns an HTTP 200 response and a JSON object with no properties. However, this response does not indicate that the custom key store is connected. To get the connection state of the custom key store, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation. During the connection process, KMS finds the CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store, creates the connection infrastructure, connects to the cluster, logs into the CloudHSM client as the kmsuser CU, and rotates its password. The ConnectCustomKeyStore operation might fail for various reasons. To find the reason, use the DescribeCustomKeyStores operation and see the ConnectionErrorCode in the response. For help interpreting the ConnectionErrorCode, see CustomKeyStoresListEntry. To fix the failure, use the DisconnectCustomKeyStore operation to disconnect the custom key store, correct the error, use the UpdateCustomKeyStore operation if necessary, and then use ConnectCustomKeyStore again.

    /// Adds a grant to a KMS key.  A grant is a policy instrument that allows Amazon Web Services principals to use KMS keys in cryptographic operations. It also can allow them to view a KMS key (DescribeKey) and create and manage grants. When authorizing access to a KMS key, grants are considered along with key policies and IAM policies. Grants are often used for temporary permissions because you can create one, use its permissions, and delete it without changing your key policies or IAM policies.  For detailed information about grants, including grant terminology, see Using grants in the  Key Management Service Developer Guide . For examples of working with grants in several programming languages, see Programming grants.  The CreateGrant operation returns a GrantToken and a GrantId.   When you create, retire, or revoke a grant, there might be a brief delay, usually less than five minutes, until the grant is available throughout KMS. This state is known as eventual consistency. Once the grant has achieved eventual consistency, the grantee principal can use the permissions in the grant without identifying the grant.  However, to use the permissions in the grant immediately, use the GrantToken that CreateGrant returns. For details, see Using a grant token in the  Key Management Service Developer Guide .   The CreateGrant operation also returns a GrantId. You can use the GrantId and a key identifier to identify the grant in the RetireGrant and RevokeGrant operations.

    /// Creates a unique customer managed KMS key in your Amazon Web Services account and Region.  KMS is replacing the term customer master key (CMK) with KMS key and KMS key. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.
    ///  You can use the CreateKey operation to create symmetric or asymmetric KMS keys.    Symmetric KMS keys contain a 256-bit symmetric key that never leaves KMS unencrypted. To use the KMS key, you must call KMS. You can use a symmetric KMS key to encrypt and decrypt small amounts of data, but they are typically used to generate data keys and data keys pairs. For details, see GenerateDataKey and GenerateDataKeyPair.    Asymmetric KMS keys can contain an RSA key pair or an Elliptic Curve (ECC) key pair. The private key in an asymmetric KMS key never leaves KMS unencrypted. However, you can use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key so it can be used outside of KMS. KMS keys with RSA key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt data or sign and verify messages (but not both). KMS keys with ECC key pairs can be used only to sign and verify messages.   For information about symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.
    ///  To create different types of KMS keys, use the following guidance:
    ///   Asymmetric KMS keys  To create an asymmetric KMS key, use the KeySpec parameter to specify the type of key material in the KMS key. Then, use the KeyUsage parameter to determine whether the KMS key will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign and verify. You can't change these properties after the KMS key is created.   Symmetric KMS keys  When creating a symmetric KMS key, you don't need to specify the KeySpec or KeyUsage parameters. The default value for KeySpec, SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT, and the default value for KeyUsage, ENCRYPT_DECRYPT, are the only valid values for symmetric KMS keys.    Multi-Region primary keys Imported key material  To create a multi-Region primary key in the local Amazon Web Services Region, use the MultiRegion parameter with a value of True. To create a multi-Region replica key, that is, a KMS key with the same key ID and key material as a primary key, but in a different Amazon Web Services Region, use the ReplicateKey operation. To change a replica key to a primary key, and its primary key to a replica key, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion operation. This operation supports multi-Region keys, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. You can create symmetric and asymmetric multi-Region keys and multi-Region keys with imported key material. You cannot create multi-Region keys in a custom key store.    To import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric KMS key with no key material. To do this, use the Origin parameter of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL. Next, use GetParametersForImport operation to get a public key and import token, and use the public key to encrypt your key material. Then, use ImportKeyMaterial with your import token to import the key material. For step-by-step instructions, see Importing Key Material in the  Key Management Service Developer Guide . You cannot import the key material into an asymmetric KMS key. To create a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, use the Origin parameter of CreateKey with a value of EXTERNAL and the MultiRegion parameter with a value of True. To create replicas of the multi-Region primary key, use the ReplicateKey operation. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.   Custom key store  To create a symmetric KMS key in a custom key store, use the CustomKeyStoreId parameter to specify the custom key store. You must also use the Origin parameter with a value of AWS_CLOUDHSM. The CloudHSM cluster that is associated with the custom key store must have at least two active HSMs in different Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region.  You cannot create an asymmetric KMS key in a custom key store. For information about custom key stores in KMS see Using Custom Key Stores in the  Key Management Service Developer Guide .    Cross-account use:  No. You cannot use this operation to create a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account.

    /// Decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted by a KMS key using any of the following operations:    Encrypt     GenerateDataKey     GenerateDataKeyPair     GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext     GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext    You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted under a symmetric or asymmetric KMS key. When the KMS key is asymmetric, you must specify the KMS key and the encryption algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information about symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of KMS by the public key in an KMS asymmetric KMS key. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric KMS key, the KeyId parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the KeyId parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS only uses the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the Decrypt operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend. Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the Decrypt operation on a particular KMS key, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user Decrypt permission on all KMS keys. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by KMS keys in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account KMS key permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for Decrypt permissions, limit the user to particular KMS keys or particular trusted accounts. For details, see Best practices for IAM policies in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Applications in Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves can call this operation by using the Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves Development Kit. For information about the supporting parameters, see How Amazon Web Services Nitro Enclaves use KMS in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

Also, aliases do not appear in the response from the DescribeKey operation. To get the aliases of all KMS keys, use the ListAliases operation.  Each KMS key can have multiple aliases.

Before deleting the key store, verify that you will never need to use any of the KMS keys in the key store for any cryptographic operations. Then, use ScheduleKeyDeletion to delete the KMS keys from the key store. When the scheduled waiting period expires, the ScheduleKeyDeletion operation deletes the KMS keys. Then it makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated cluster. However, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. After all KMS keys are deleted from KMS, use DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect the key store from KMS. Then, you can delete the custom key store. Instead of deleting the custom key store, consider using DisconnectCustomKeyStore to disconnect it from KMS.

    /// Decrypts ciphertext and then reencrypts it entirely within KMS. You can use this operation to change the KMS key under which data is encrypted, such as when you manually rotate a KMS key or change the KMS key that protects a ciphertext. You can also use it to reencrypt ciphertext under the same KMS key, such as to change the encryption context of a ciphertext. The ReEncrypt operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using an KMS KMS key in an KMS operation, such as Encrypt or GenerateDataKey. It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an asymmetric KMS key outside of KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the Amazon Web Services Encryption SDK or Amazon S3 client-side encryption. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with KMS. When you use the ReEncrypt operation, you need to provide information for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.   If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric KMS key, you must use the SourceKeyId parameter to identify the KMS key that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.   If your ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric KMS key, the SourceKeyId parameter is optional. KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the source KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the SourceKeyId parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS uses only the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the ReEncrypt operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.           To reencrypt the data, you must use the DestinationKeyId parameter specify the KMS key that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric KMS key. If the destination KMS key is an asymmetric KMS key, you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the KMS key.
    ///   When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same KMS key and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the KMS key and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails. You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric KMS keys because KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob. KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.

    /// Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This operation creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region primary key in a different Region of the same Amazon Web Services partition. You can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a different Region. To create a multi-Region primary key, use the CreateKey operation. This operation supports multi-Region keys, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. A replica key is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable. They have the same key ID and key material. They also have the same key spec, key usage, key material origin, and automatic key rotation status. KMS automatically synchronizes these shared properties among related multi-Region keys. All other properties of a replica key can differ, including its key policy, tags, aliases, and key state. KMS pricing and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and replica key. When this operation completes, the new replica key has a transient key state of Creating. This key state changes to Enabled (or PendingImport) after a few seconds when the process of creating the new replica key is complete. While the key state is Creating, you can manage key, but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations. If you are creating and using the replica key programmatically, retry on KMSInvalidStateException or call DescribeKey to check its KeyState value before using it. For details about the Creating key state, see Key state: Effect on your KMS key in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. The CloudTrail log of a ReplicateKey operation records a ReplicateKey operation in the primary key's Region and a CreateKey operation in the replica key's Region.     If you replicate a multi-Region primary key with imported key material, the replica key is created with no key material. You must import the same key material that you imported into the primary key. For details, see Importing key material into multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. To convert a replica key to a primary key, use the UpdatePrimaryRegion operation.

When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes to PendingDeletion and the key can't be used in any cryptographic operations. It remains in this state for the duration of the waiting period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use CancelKeyDeletion to cancel the deletion of the KMS key. After the waiting period ends, KMS deletes the KMS key, its key material, and all KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.  Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a KMS key is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the KMS key is unrecoverable. (The only exception is a multi-Region replica key.) To prevent the use of a KMS key without deleting it, use DisableKey.   If you schedule deletion of a KMS key from a custom key store, when the waiting period expires, ScheduleKeyDeletion deletes the KMS key from KMS. Then KMS makes a best effort to delete the key material from the associated CloudHSM cluster. However, you might need to manually delete the orphaned key material from the cluster and its backups. You can schedule the deletion of a multi-Region primary key and its replica keys at any time. However, KMS will not delete a multi-Region primary key with existing replica keys. If you schedule the deletion of a primary key with replicas, its key state changes to PendingReplicaDeletion and it cannot be replicated or used in cryptographic operations. This status can continue indefinitely. When the last of its replicas keys is deleted (not just scheduled), the key state of the primary key changes to PendingDeletion and its waiting period (PendingWindowInDays) begins.

To verify the signature, use the Verify operation, or use the public key in the same asymmetric KMS key outside of KMS. For information about symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair, such as an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric KMS key. The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key to sign a message. Anyone with the public key can verify that the message was signed with that particular private key and that the message hasn't changed since it was signed.  To use the Sign operation, provide the following information:   Use the KeyId parameter to identify an asymmetric KMS key with a KeyUsage value of SIGN_VERIFY. To get the KeyUsage value of a KMS key, use the DescribeKey operation. The caller must have kms:Sign permission on the KMS key.   Use the Message parameter to specify the message or message digest to sign. You can submit messages of up to 4096 bytes. To sign a larger message, generate a hash digest of the message, and then provide the hash digest in the Message parameter. To indicate whether the message is a full message or a digest, use the MessageType parameter.   Choose a signing algorithm that is compatible with the KMS key.     When signing a message, be sure to record the KMS key and the signing algorithm. This information is required to verify the signature.

    /// Verifies a digital signature that was generated by the Sign operation.   Verification confirms that an authorized user signed the message with the specified KMS key and signing algorithm, and the message hasn't changed since it was signed. If the signature is verified, the value of the SignatureValid field in the response is True. If the signature verification fails, the Verify operation fails with an KMSInvalidSignatureException exception. A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric KMS key. The signature is verified by using the public key in the same asymmetric KMS key. For information about symmetric and asymmetric KMS keys, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric KMS keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. To verify a digital signature, you can use the Verify operation. Specify the same asymmetric KMS key, message, and signing algorithm that were used to produce the signature. You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the KMS key outside of KMS. Use the GetPublicKey operation to download the public key in the asymmetric KMS key and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of KMS. The advantage of using the Verify operation is that it is performed within KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is performed within the FIPS boundary, it is logged in CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the KMS key to verify signatures.  The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For
