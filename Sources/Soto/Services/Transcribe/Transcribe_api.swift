/// Service object for interacting with AWS Transcribe service.
///
/// Amazon Transcribe offers three main types of batch transcription: Standard, Medical, and Call Analytics.    Standard transcriptions are the most common option. Refer to  for details.    Medical transcriptions are tailored to medical professionals and incorporate medical terms. A common use case for this service is transcribing doctor-patient dialogue into after-visit notes. Refer to for details.    Call Analytics transcriptions are designed for use with call center audio on two different channels; if you're looking for insight into customer service calls, use this option. Refer to  for details.

Specifying POST_CALL assigns your category to post-call transcriptions;  categories with this input type cannot be applied to streaming (real-time)  transcriptions. Specifying REAL_TIME assigns your category to streaming transcriptions;  categories with this input type cannot be applied to post-call transcriptions.

Custom vocabulary filters are commonly used to mask profanity in transcripts. Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your custom vocabulary filter request fails. Refer to Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies to get the character set for your language. For more information, see Vocabulary filtering.
    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - dataAccessRoleArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permissions to access the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your input files (in this case, your custom vocabulary filter). If the role that you specify doesn’t have the appropriate permissions to access the specified Amazon S3 location, your request fails. IAM role ARNs have the format arn:partition:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path. For example: arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin. For more information, see IAM ARNs.
    ///   - languageCode: The language code that represents the language of the entries in your vocabulary filter. Each custom vocabulary filter must contain terms in only one language. A custom vocabulary filter can only be used to transcribe files in the same language as the filter. For example, if you create a custom vocabulary filter using US English (en-US), you can only apply this filter to files that contain English audio. For a list of supported languages and their associated language codes, refer to the Supported languages table.
    ///   - tags: Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a new custom vocabulary filter at the time you create this new vocabulary filter. To learn more about using tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to Tagging resources.
    ///   - vocabularyFilterFileUri: The Amazon S3 location of the text file that contains your custom vocabulary filter terms. The URI must be located in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the resource you're calling. Here's an example URI path: s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-vocab-filter-file.txt  Note that if you include VocabularyFilterFileUri in your request, you cannot use Words; you must choose one or the other.
    ///   - vocabularyFilterName: A unique name, chosen by you, for your new custom vocabulary filter. This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a new custom vocabulary filter with the same name as an existing custom vocabulary filter, you get a ConflictException error.
    ///   - words: Use this parameter if you want to create your custom vocabulary filter by including all desired terms, as comma-separated values, within your request. The other option for creating your vocabulary filter is to save your entries in a text file and upload them to an Amazon S3 bucket, then specify the location of your file using the VocabularyFilterFileUri parameter. Note that if you include Words in your request, you cannot use VocabularyFilterFileUri; you must choose one or the other. Each language has a character set that contains all allowed characters for that specific language. If you use unsupported characters, your custom vocabulary filter request fails.

If the role that you specify doesn’t have the appropriate permissions to access the specified Amazon S3 location, your request fails. IAM role ARNs have the format arn:partition:iam::account:role/role-name-with-path. For example: arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/Admin. For more information, see IAM ARNs.

Use an alias for the KMS key ID. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.   Use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use the ARN for the KMS key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias.   If using a key located in a different Amazon Web Services account than the current Amazon Web Services account, you can specify your KMS key in one of two ways:   Use the ARN for the KMS key ID.

If you do not specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3). If you specify a KMS key to encrypt your output, you must also specify an output location using the OutputLocation parameter. Note that the role making the  request must have permission to use the specified KMS key.
    ///   - outputLocation: The Amazon S3 location where you want your Call Analytics transcription output stored.

You can specify a KMS key to encrypt your output using the OutputEncryptionKMSKeyId parameter. If you do not specify a KMS key, Amazon Transcribe uses the default Amazon S3 key for server-side encryption.

    /// Transcribes the audio from a medical dictation or conversation and applies any additional Request Parameters you choose to include in your request. In addition to many standard transcription features, Amazon Transcribe Medical provides you with a robust medical vocabulary and, optionally, content identification, which adds flags to personal health information (PHI). To learn more about these features, refer to How Amazon Transcribe Medical works. To make a StartMedicalTranscriptionJob request, you must first upload your media file into an Amazon S3 bucket; you can then specify the Amazon S3 location of the file using the Media parameter. You must include the following parameters in your StartMedicalTranscriptionJob request:    region: The Amazon Web Services Region where you are making your request. For a list of Amazon Web Services Regions supported with Amazon Transcribe, refer to Amazon Transcribe endpoints and quotas.    MedicalTranscriptionJobName: A custom name you create for your transcription job that is unique within your Amazon Web Services account.    Media (MediaFileUri): The Amazon S3 location of your media file.    LanguageCode: This must be en-US.    OutputBucketName: The Amazon S3 bucket where you want your transcript stored. If you want your output stored in a sub-folder of this bucket, you must also include OutputKey.    Specialty: This must be PRIMARYCARE.    Type: Choose whether your audio is a conversation or a dictation.
    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - contentIdentificationType: Labels all personal health information (PHI) identified in your transcript. For more information, see Identifying personal health information (PHI) in a transcription.
    ///   - kmsEncryptionContext: A map of plain text, non-secret key:value pairs, known as encryption context pairs, that provide an added layer of security for your data. For more information, see KMS encryption context and Asymmetric keys in KMS.
    ///   - languageCode: The language code that represents the language spoken in the input media file. US English (en-US) is the only valid value for medical transcription jobs. Any other value you enter for language code results in a BadRequestException error.
    ///   - media: 
    ///   - mediaFormat: Specify the format of your input media file.
    ///   - mediaSampleRateHertz: The sample rate, in hertz, of the audio track in your input media file. If you do not specify the media sample rate, Amazon Transcribe Medical determines it for you. If you specify the sample rate, it must match the rate detected by Amazon Transcribe Medical; if there's a mismatch between the value that you specify and the value detected, your job fails. Therefore, in most cases, it's advised to omit MediaSampleRateHertz and let Amazon Transcribe Medical determine the sample rate.
    ///   - medicalTranscriptionJobName: A unique name, chosen by you, for your medical transcription job. The name that you specify is also used as the default name of your transcription output file. If you want to specify a different name for your transcription output, use the OutputKey parameter. This name is case sensitive, cannot contain spaces, and must be unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a new job with the same name as an existing job, you get a ConflictException error.
    ///   - outputBucketName: The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where you want your medical transcription output stored. Do not include the S3:// prefix of the specified bucket. If you want your output to go to a sub-folder of this bucket, specify it using the OutputKey parameter; OutputBucketName only accepts the name of a bucket. For example, if you want your output stored in S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET, set OutputBucketName to DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET. However, if you want your output stored in S3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/, set OutputBucketName to DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET and OutputKey to test-files/. Note that Amazon Transcribe must have permission to use the specified location. You can change Amazon S3 permissions using the Amazon Web Services Management Console. See also Permissions Required for IAM User Roles.
    ///   - outputEncryptionKMSKeyId: The KMS key you want to use to encrypt your medical transcription output. If using a key located in the current Amazon Web Services account, you can specify your KMS key in one of four ways:   Use the KMS key ID itself. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use an alias for the KMS key ID. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.   Use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS key ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use the ARN for the KMS key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias.   If using a key located in a different Amazon Web Services account than the current Amazon Web Services account, you can specify your KMS key in one of two ways:   Use the ARN for the KMS key ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Use the ARN for the KMS key alias. For example, arn:aws:kms:region:account-ID:alias/ExampleAlias.   If you do not specify an encryption key, your output is encrypted with the default Amazon S3 key (SSE-S3). If you specify a KMS key to encrypt your output, you must also specify an output location using the OutputLocation parameter. Note that the role making the  request must have permission to use the specified KMS key.
    ///   - outputKey: Use in combination with OutputBucketName to specify the output location of your transcript and, optionally, a unique name for your output file. The default name for your transcription output is the same as the name you specified for your medical transcription job (MedicalTranscriptionJobName). Here are some examples of how you can use OutputKey:   If you specify 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName and 'my-transcript.json' as the OutputKey, your transcription output path is s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript.json.   If you specify 'my-first-transcription' as the MedicalTranscriptionJobName, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName, and 'my-transcript' as the OutputKey, your transcription output path is s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json.   If you specify 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName and 'test-files/my-transcript.json' as the OutputKey, your transcription output path is s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-transcript.json.   If you specify 'my-first-transcription' as the MedicalTranscriptionJobName, 'DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET' as the OutputBucketName, and 'test-files/my-transcript' as the OutputKey, your transcription output path is s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/test-files/my-transcript/my-first-transcription.json.   If you specify the name of an Amazon S3 bucket sub-folder that doesn't exist, one is created for you.
    ///   - settings: Specify additional optional settings in your  request, including channel identification, alternative transcriptions, and speaker partitioning. You can use that to apply custom vocabularies to your transcription job.
    ///   - specialty: Specify the predominant medical specialty represented in your media. For batch transcriptions, PRIMARYCARE is the only valid value. If you require additional specialties, refer to .
    ///   - tags: Adds one or more custom tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a new medical transcription job at the time you start this new job. To learn more about using tags with Amazon Transcribe, refer to Tagging resources.
    ///   - type: Specify whether your input media contains only one person (DICTATION) or contains a conversation between two people (CONVERSATION). For example, DICTATION could be used for a medical professional wanting to transcribe voice memos; CONVERSATION could be used for transcribing the doctor-patient dialogue during the patient's office visit.

    ///   - identifyLanguage: Enables automatic language identification in your transcription job request. Use this parameter if your media file contains only one language. If your media contains multiple languages, use IdentifyMultipleLanguages instead. If you include IdentifyLanguage, you can optionally include a list of language codes, using LanguageOptions, that you think may be present in your media file. Including LanguageOptions restricts IdentifyLanguage to only the language options that you specify, which can improve transcription accuracy. If you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter to your automatic language identification request, include LanguageIdSettings with the relevant sub-parameters (VocabularyName, LanguageModelName, and VocabularyFilterName). If you include LanguageIdSettings, also include LanguageOptions. Note that you must include one of LanguageCode, IdentifyLanguage, or IdentifyMultipleLanguages in your request. If you include more than one of these parameters, your transcription job fails.

    ///   - jobExecutionSettings: Makes it possible to control how your transcription job is processed. Currently, the only JobExecutionSettings modification you can choose is enabling job queueing using the AllowDeferredExecution sub-parameter. If you include JobExecutionSettings in your request, you must also include the sub-parameters: AllowDeferredExecution and DataAccessRoleArn.

    ///   - languageIdSettings: If using automatic language identification in your request and you want to apply a custom language model, a custom vocabulary, or a custom vocabulary filter, include LanguageIdSettings with the relevant sub-parameters (VocabularyName, LanguageModelName, and VocabularyFilterName). Note that multi-language identification (IdentifyMultipleLanguages) doesn't support custom language models.  LanguageIdSettings supports two to five language codes. Each language code you include can have an associated custom language model, custom vocabulary, and custom vocabulary filter. The language codes that you specify must match the languages of the associated custom language models, custom vocabularies, and custom vocabulary filters. It's recommended that you include LanguageOptions when using LanguageIdSettings to ensure that the correct language dialect is identified. For example, if you specify a custom vocabulary that is in en-US but Amazon Transcribe determines that the language spoken in your media is en-AU, your custom vocabulary is not applied to your transcription. If you include LanguageOptions and include en-US as the only English language dialect, your custom vocabulary is applied to your transcription. If you want to include a custom language model with your request but do not want to use automatic language identification, use instead the  parameter with the LanguageModelName sub-parameter. If you want to include a custom vocabulary or a custom vocabulary filter (or both) with your request but do not want to use automatic language identification, use instead the  parameter with the VocabularyName or VocabularyFilterName (or both) sub-parameter.
