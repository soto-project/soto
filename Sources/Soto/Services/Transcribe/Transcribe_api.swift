/// Service object for interacting with AWS Transcribe service.
///
/// Amazon Transcribe offers three main types of batch transcription: Standard, Medical, and Call Analytics.    Standard transcriptions are the most common option. Refer to  for details.    Medical transcriptions are tailored to medical professionals and incorporate medical terms. A common use case for this service is transcribing doctor-patient dialogue into after-visit notes. Refer to for details.    Call Analytics transcriptions are designed for use with call center audio on two different channels; if you're looking for insight into customer service calls, use this option. Refer to  for details.
