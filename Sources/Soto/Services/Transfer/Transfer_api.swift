/// Service object for interacting with AWS Transfer service.
///
/// Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon EFS. Additionally, you can use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) to transfer files into and out of Amazon S3. Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with Amazon Web Services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - externalId: A unique identifier that is required to identify specific groups within your directory. The users of the group that you associate have access to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols using Transfer Family. If you know the group name, you can view the SID values by running the following command using Windows PowerShell.  Get-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like "YourGroupName*"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid  In that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your Active Directory group. The regular expression used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-
    ///   - homeDirectory: The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client. A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory.  The HomeDirectory parameter is only used if HomeDirectoryType is set to PATH.
    ///   - homeDirectoryMappings: Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role provides access to paths in Target. This value can be set only when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL. The following is an Entry and Target pair example.  [ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]  In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot.  [ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]
    ///   - homeDirectoryType: The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to PATH, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer  protocol clients. If you set it to LOGICAL, you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for  how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.  If HomeDirectoryType is LOGICAL, you must provide mappings, using the HomeDirectoryMappings parameter. If, on the other hand, HomeDirectoryType is PATH, you provide an absolute path using the HomeDirectory parameter. You cannot have both HomeDirectory and HomeDirectoryMappings in your template.
    ///   - policy: A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName}, ${Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and ${Transfer:HomeBucket}.  This policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies. For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument. For an example of a session policy, see Example session policy. For more information, see AssumeRole in the Security Token Service API Reference.

The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users  when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust  relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.

    ///   - accessRole: Connectors are used to send files using either the AS2 or SFTP protocol. For the access role, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management role to use.  For AS2 connectors  With AS2, you can send files by calling StartFileTransfer and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, SendFilePaths. We use the file’s parent directory (for example, for --send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt, parent directory is /bucket/dir/) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the AccessRole needs to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the file location used in the StartFileTransfer request. Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the files that you intend to send with StartFileTransfer. If you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead of the Amazon Web Services managed key in Secrets Manager, then the role also needs the kms:Decrypt permission for that key.  For SFTP connectors  Make sure that the access role provides read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in the StartFileTransfer request. Additionally,  make sure that the role provides secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission to Secrets Manager.

    ///   - endpointDetails: The virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint settings that are configured for your server. When you host your endpoint within your VPC, you can make your endpoint accessible only to resources within your VPC, or you can attach Elastic IP addresses and make your endpoint accessible to clients over the internet. Your VPC's default security groups are automatically assigned to your endpoint.
    ///   - endpointType: The type of endpoint that you want your server to use. You can choose to make your server's endpoint publicly accessible (PUBLIC) or host it inside your VPC. With an endpoint that is hosted in a VPC, you can restrict access to your server and  resources only within your VPC or choose to make it internet facing by attaching Elastic IP addresses directly to it.  After May 19, 2021, you won't be able to create a server using EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in your Amazon Web Services account if your account hasn't already done so before May 19, 2021. If you have already created servers with EndpointType=VPC_ENDPOINT in your Amazon Web Services account on or before May 19, 2021, you will not be affected. After this date, use EndpointType=VPC. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transfer/latest/userguide/create-server-in-vpc.html#deprecate-vpc-endpoint. It is recommended that you use VPC as the EndpointType. With this endpoint type, you have the option to directly associate up to three Elastic IPv4 addresses (BYO IP included) with your server's endpoint and use VPC security groups to restrict traffic by the client's public IP address. This is not possible with EndpointType set to VPC_ENDPOINT.

Valid values for the -b option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521. Use the following command to generate an ED25519 key with no passphrase:  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f my-new-server-key. For all of these commands, you can replace my-new-server-key with a string of your choice.  If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP-enabled server to a new server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive.  For more information, see Manage host keys for your SFTP-enabled server in the Transfer Family User Guide.
    ///   - identityProviderDetails: Required when IdentityProviderType is set to AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, Amazon Web Services_LAMBDA or API_GATEWAY. Accepts an array containing all of the information required to use a directory in AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE or invoke a customer-supplied authentication API, including the API Gateway URL. Not required when IdentityProviderType is set to SERVICE_MANAGED.
    ///   - identityProviderType: The mode of authentication for a server. The default value is SERVICE_MANAGED, which allows you to store and access user credentials within the Transfer Family service. Use AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE to provide access to Active Directory groups in Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory in your on-premises environment or in Amazon Web Services using AD Connector. This option also requires you to provide a Directory ID by using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter. Use the API_GATEWAY value to integrate with an identity provider of your choosing. The API_GATEWAY setting requires you to provide an Amazon API Gateway endpoint URL to call for authentication by using the IdentityProviderDetails parameter. Use the AWS_LAMBDA value to directly use an Lambda function as your identity provider.  If you choose this value, you must specify the ARN for the Lambda function in the Function parameter  for the IdentityProviderDetails data type.
    ///   - loggingRole: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon S3 or Amazon EFSevents. When set, you can view user activity in your CloudWatch logs.
    ///   - postAuthenticationLoginBanner: Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This string is displayed after the user authenticates.  The SFTP protocol does not support post-authentication display banners.
    ///   - preAuthenticationLoginBanner: Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This string is displayed before the user authenticates. For example, the following banner displays details about using the system:  This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals using this computer system without authority, or in excess of their authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel.
    ///   - protocolDetails: The protocol settings that are configured for your server.    To indicate passive mode (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the PassiveIp parameter. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer.    To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to use the SETSTAT command on a file that you are  uploading to an Amazon S3 bucket, use the SetStatOption parameter. To have the Transfer Family server ignore the  SETSTAT command and upload files without needing to make any changes to your SFTP client, set the value to  ENABLE_NO_OP. If you set the SetStatOption parameter to ENABLE_NO_OP, Transfer Family  generates a log entry to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is making a SETSTAT  call.   To determine whether your Transfer Family server resumes recent, negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the  TlsSessionResumptionMode parameter.    As2Transports indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages. Currently, only HTTP is supported.
    ///   - protocols: Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The available protocols are:    SFTP (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer over SSH    FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS encryption    FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer    AS2 (Applicability Statement 2): used for transporting structured business-to-business data      If you select FTPS, you must choose a certificate stored in Certificate Manager (ACM)  which is used to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS.   If Protocol includes either FTP or FTPS, then the EndpointType must be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must be either AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY.   If Protocol includes FTP, then AddressAllocationIds cannot be associated.   If Protocol is set only to SFTP, the EndpointType can be set to PUBLIC and the IdentityProviderType can be set any of the supported identity types:  SERVICE_MANAGED, AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY.   If Protocol includes AS2, then the EndpointType must be VPC, and domain must be Amazon S3.
    ///   - s3StorageOptions: Specifies whether or not performance for your Amazon S3 directories is optimized. This is disabled by default. By default, home directory mappings have a TYPE of DIRECTORY. If you enable this option, you would then need to explicitly set the HomeDirectoryMapEntry Type to FILE if you want a mapping to have a file target.
    ///   - securityPolicyName: Specifies the name of the security policy for the server.
    ///   - structuredLogDestinations: Specifies the log groups to which your server logs are sent. To specify a log group, you must provide the ARN for an existing log group. In this case, the format of the log group is as follows:  arn:aws:logs:region-name:amazon-account-id:log-group:log-group-name:*  For example, arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:mytestgroup:*  If you have previously specified a log group for a server, you can clear it, and in effect turn off structured logging, by providing an empty value for this parameter in an update-server call. For example:  update-server --server-id s-1234567890abcdef0 --structured-log-destinations
    ///   - tags: Key-value pairs that can be used to group and search for servers.
    ///   - workflowDetails: Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execution role that's used for executing the workflow. In addition to a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded completely, WorkflowDetails can also contain a workflow ID (and execution role) for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A partial upload occurs when the server session disconnects while the file is still being uploaded.

    ///   - homeDirectory: The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client. A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory.  The HomeDirectory parameter is only used if HomeDirectoryType is set to PATH.
    ///   - homeDirectoryMappings: Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role provides access to paths in Target. This value can be set only when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL. The following is an Entry and Target pair example.  [ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]  In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock your user down to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the value the user should see for their home directory when they log in. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot.  [ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]
    ///   - homeDirectoryType: The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to PATH, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer  protocol clients. If you set it to LOGICAL, you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for  how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.  If HomeDirectoryType is LOGICAL, you must provide mappings, using the HomeDirectoryMappings parameter. If, on the other hand, HomeDirectoryType is PATH, you provide an absolute path using the HomeDirectory parameter. You cannot have both HomeDirectory and HomeDirectoryMappings in your template.
    ///   - policy: A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName}, ${Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and ${Transfer:HomeBucket}.  This policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies. For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument. For an example of a session policy, see Example session policy. For more information, see AssumeRole in the Amazon Web Services Security Token Service API Reference.
    ///   - posixProfile: Specifies the full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid), group ID (Gid), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids), that controls your users' access to your Amazon EFS file systems. The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in Amazon EFS determine the level of access your users get when transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.
    ///   - role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3  bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users  when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust  relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.
    ///   - serverId: A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance. This is the specific server that you added your user to.
    ///   - sshPublicKeyBody: The public portion of the Secure Shell (SSH) key used to authenticate the user to the server. The three standard SSH public key format elements are &lt;key type&gt;, &lt;body base64&gt;, and  an optional &lt;comment&gt;, with spaces between each element. Transfer Family accepts RSA, ECDSA, and ED25519 keys.   For RSA keys, the key type  is ssh-rsa.   For ED25519 keys, the key type is ssh-ed25519.   For ECDSA keys, the key type is either ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, or ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, depending on the size of the key you generated.

The users of the group that you associate have access to your Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS resources over the enabled protocols using Transfer Family. If you know the group name, you can view the SID values by running the following command using Windows PowerShell.  Get-ADGroup -Filter {samAccountName -like "YourGroupName*"} -Properties * | Select SamAccountName,ObjectSid  In that command, replace YourGroupName with the name of your Active Directory group. The regular expression used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of uppercase and lowercase alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-
    ///   - homeDirectory: The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client. A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory.  The HomeDirectory parameter is only used if HomeDirectoryType is set to PATH.
    ///   - homeDirectoryMappings: Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role provides access to paths in Target. This value can be set only when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL. The following is an Entry and Target pair example.  [ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]  In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot.  [ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]
    ///   - homeDirectoryType: The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to PATH, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer  protocol clients. If you set it to LOGICAL, you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for  how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.  If HomeDirectoryType is LOGICAL, you must provide mappings, using the HomeDirectoryMappings parameter. If, on the other hand, HomeDirectoryType is PATH, you provide an absolute path using the HomeDirectory parameter. You cannot have both HomeDirectory and HomeDirectoryMappings in your template.
    ///   - policy: A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName}, ${Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and ${Transfer:HomeBucket}.  This policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies. For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument. For an example of a session policy, see Example session policy. For more information, see AssumeRole in the Amazon Web ServicesSecurity Token Service API Reference.

The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users  when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system.

For the access role, provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management role to use.  For AS2 connectors  With AS2, you can send files by calling StartFileTransfer and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, SendFilePaths. We use the file’s parent directory (for example, for --send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt, parent directory is /bucket/dir/) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the AccessRole needs to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the file location used in the StartFileTransfer request. Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the files that you intend to send with StartFileTransfer. If you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead of the Amazon Web Services managed key in Secrets Manager, then the role also needs the kms:Decrypt permission for that key.  For SFTP connectors  Make sure that the access role provides read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in the StartFileTransfer request. Additionally,  make sure that the role provides secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission to Secrets Manager.

Valid values for the -b option for ECDSA are 256, 384, and 521. Use the following command to generate an ED25519 key with no passphrase:  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f my-new-server-key. For all of these commands, you can replace my-new-server-key with a string of your choice.  If you aren't planning to migrate existing users from an existing SFTP-enabled server to a new server, don't update the host key. Accidentally changing a server's host key can be disruptive.  For more information, see Manage host keys for your SFTP-enabled server in the Transfer Family User Guide.
    ///   - identityProviderDetails: An array containing all of the information required to call a customer's authentication API method.
    ///   - loggingRole: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that allows a server to turn on Amazon CloudWatch logging for Amazon S3 or Amazon EFSevents. When set, you can view user activity in your CloudWatch logs.
    ///   - postAuthenticationLoginBanner: Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This string is displayed after the user authenticates.  The SFTP protocol does not support post-authentication display banners.
    ///   - preAuthenticationLoginBanner: Specifies a string to display when users connect to a server. This string is displayed before the user authenticates. For example, the following banner displays details about using the system:  This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals using this computer system without authority, or in excess of their authority, are subject to having all of their activities on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel.
    ///   - protocolDetails: The protocol settings that are configured for your server.    To indicate passive mode (for FTP and FTPS protocols), use the PassiveIp parameter. Enter a single dotted-quad IPv4 address, such as the external IP address of a firewall, router, or load balancer.    To ignore the error that is generated when the client attempts to use the SETSTAT command on a file that you are  uploading to an Amazon S3 bucket, use the SetStatOption parameter. To have the Transfer Family server ignore the  SETSTAT command and upload files without needing to make any changes to your SFTP client, set the value to  ENABLE_NO_OP. If you set the SetStatOption parameter to ENABLE_NO_OP, Transfer Family  generates a log entry to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so that you can determine when the client is making a SETSTAT  call.   To determine whether your Transfer Family server resumes recent, negotiated sessions through a unique session ID, use the  TlsSessionResumptionMode parameter.    As2Transports indicates the transport method for the AS2 messages. Currently, only HTTP is supported.
    ///   - protocols: Specifies the file transfer protocol or protocols over which your file transfer protocol client can connect to your server's endpoint. The available protocols are:    SFTP (Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol): File transfer over SSH    FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure): File transfer with TLS encryption    FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Unencrypted file transfer    AS2 (Applicability Statement 2): used for transporting structured business-to-business data      If you select FTPS, you must choose a certificate stored in Certificate Manager (ACM)  which is used to identify your server when clients connect to it over FTPS.   If Protocol includes either FTP or FTPS, then the EndpointType must be VPC and the IdentityProviderType must be either AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY.   If Protocol includes FTP, then AddressAllocationIds cannot be associated.   If Protocol is set only to SFTP, the EndpointType can be set to PUBLIC and the IdentityProviderType can be set any of the supported identity types:  SERVICE_MANAGED, AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE, AWS_LAMBDA, or API_GATEWAY.   If Protocol includes AS2, then the EndpointType must be VPC, and domain must be Amazon S3.
    ///   - s3StorageOptions: Specifies whether or not performance for your Amazon S3 directories is optimized. This is disabled by default. By default, home directory mappings have a TYPE of DIRECTORY. If you enable this option, you would then need to explicitly set the HomeDirectoryMapEntry Type to FILE if you want a mapping to have a file target.
    ///   - securityPolicyName: Specifies the name of the security policy for the server.
    ///   - serverId: A system-assigned unique identifier for a server instance that the Transfer Family user is assigned to.
    ///   - structuredLogDestinations: Specifies the log groups to which your server logs are sent. To specify a log group, you must provide the ARN for an existing log group. In this case, the format of the log group is as follows:  arn:aws:logs:region-name:amazon-account-id:log-group:log-group-name:*  For example, arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:111122223333:log-group:mytestgroup:*  If you have previously specified a log group for a server, you can clear it, and in effect turn off structured logging, by providing an empty value for this parameter in an update-server call. For example:  update-server --server-id s-1234567890abcdef0 --structured-log-destinations
    ///   - workflowDetails: Specifies the workflow ID for the workflow to assign and the execution role that's used for executing the workflow. In addition to a workflow to execute when a file is uploaded completely, WorkflowDetails can also contain a workflow ID (and execution role) for a workflow to execute on partial upload. A partial upload occurs when the server session disconnects while the file is still being uploaded. To remove an associated workflow from a server, you can provide an empty OnUpload object, as in the following example.  aws transfer update-server --server-id s-01234567890abcdef --workflow-details '{"OnUpload":[]}'

    ///   - homeDirectory: The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using the client. A HomeDirectory example is /bucket_name/home/mydirectory.  The HomeDirectory parameter is only used if HomeDirectoryType is set to PATH.
    ///   - homeDirectoryMappings: Logical directory mappings that specify what Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. You must specify the Entry and Target pair, where Entry shows how the path is made visible and Target is the actual Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS path. If you only specify a target, it is displayed as is. You also must ensure that your Identity and Access Management (IAM)  role provides access to paths in Target. This value can be set only when HomeDirectoryType is set to LOGICAL. The following is an Entry and Target pair example.  [ { "Entry": "/directory1", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]  In most cases, you can use this value instead of the session policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set Entry to '/' and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot.  [ { "Entry": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]
    ///   - homeDirectoryType: The type of landing directory (folder) that you want your users' home directory to be when they log in to the server. If you set it to PATH, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS path as is in their file transfer  protocol clients. If you set it to LOGICAL, you need to provide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for  how you want to make Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS paths visible to your users.  If HomeDirectoryType is LOGICAL, you must provide mappings, using the HomeDirectoryMappings parameter. If, on the other hand, HomeDirectoryType is PATH, you provide an absolute path using the HomeDirectory parameter. You cannot have both HomeDirectory and HomeDirectoryMappings in your template.
    ///   - policy: A session policy for your user so that you can use the same Identity and Access Management (IAM) role across multiple users. This policy scopes down a user's access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName}, ${Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and ${Transfer:HomeBucket}.  This policy applies only when the domain of ServerId is Amazon S3. Amazon EFS does not use session policies. For session policies, Transfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument. For an example of a session policy, see Creating a session policy. For more information, see AssumeRole in the Amazon Web Services Security Token Service API Reference.
    ///   - posixProfile: Specifies the full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid), group ID (Gid), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids), that controls your users' access to your Amazon Elastic File Systems (Amazon EFS). The POSIX permissions that are set on files and directories in your file system determines the level of access your users get when transferring files into and out of your Amazon EFS file systems.
    ///   - role: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that controls your users' access to your Amazon S3  bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The policies attached to this role determine the level of access that you want to provide your users  when transferring files into and out of your Amazon S3 bucket or Amazon EFS file system. The IAM role should also contain a trust  relationship that allows the server to access your resources when servicing your users' transfer requests.
    ///   - serverId: A system-assigned unique identifier for a Transfer Family server instance that the user is assigned to.
    ///   - userName: A unique string that identifies a user and is associated with a server as specified by the ServerId. This user name must be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 100 characters long.
