The following is an Entry and Target pair example.  [ { "Entry": "your-personal-report.pdf", "Target": "/bucket3/customized-reports/${transfer:UserName}.pdf" } ]  In most cases, you can use this value instead of the scope-down policy to lock down your user to the designated home directory ("chroot"). To do this, you can set Entry to / and set Target to the HomeDirectory parameter value. The following is an Entry and Target pair example for chroot.  [ { "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]   If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the s3api or efsapi call instead of s3 or efs so you can use the put-object operation.

[ { "Entry:": "/", "Target": "/bucket_name/home/mydirectory" } ]   If the target of a logical directory entry does not exist in Amazon S3 or EFS, the entry is ignored. As a workaround, you can use the Amazon S3 API or EFS API to create 0 byte objects as place holders for your directory. If using the CLI, use the s3api or efsapi call instead of s3 or efs so you can use the put-object operation. For example, you use the following: aws s3api put-object --bucket bucketname --key path/to/folder/. Make sure that the end of the key name ends in a / for it to be considered a folder.

If you set it to PATH, the user will see the absolute Amazon S3 bucket or EFS paths as is in their file transfer protocol clients. If you set it LOGICAL, you will need to provide mappings in the HomeDirectoryMappings for how you want to make Amazon S3 or EFS paths visible to your users.

Variables that you can use inside this policy include ${Transfer:UserName}, ${Transfer:HomeDirectory}, and ${Transfer:HomeBucket}.  This only applies when domain of ServerId is S3. Amazon EFS does not use scope-down policies. For scope-down policies, Amazon Web ServicesTransfer Family stores the policy as a JSON blob, instead of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy. You save the policy as a JSON blob and pass it in the Policy argument. For an example of a scope-down policy, see Creating a scope-down policy.
