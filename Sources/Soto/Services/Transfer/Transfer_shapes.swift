If the connector should use Basic authentication, the secret needs to be in the following format:  { "Username": "user-name", "Password": "user-password" }  Replace user-name and user-password with the credentials for the actual user that is being authenticated. Note the following:   You are storing these credentials in Secrets Manager, not passing them directly into this API.   If you are using the API, SDKs, or CloudFormation to configure your connector, then you must create the secret before you can enable Basic authentication. However, if you are using the Amazon Web Services management console, you can have the system create the secret for you.   If you have previously enabled Basic authentication for a connector, you can disable it by using the UpdateConnector API call.

Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the files that you intend to send with StartFileTransfer. If you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission for the secret.

For SFTP connectors  Make sure that the access role provides read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in the StartFileTransfer request.

For AS2 connectors  With AS2, you can send files by calling StartFileTransfer and specifying the file paths in the request parameter, SendFilePaths. We use the file’s parent directory (for example, for --send-file-paths /bucket/dir/file.txt, parent directory is /bucket/dir/) to temporarily store a processed AS2 message file, store the MDN when we receive them from the partner, and write a final JSON file containing relevant metadata of the transmission. So, the AccessRole needs to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the file location used in the StartFileTransfer request. Additionally, you need to provide read and write access to the parent directory of the files that you intend to send with StartFileTransfer. If you are using Basic authentication for your AS2 connector, the access role requires the secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission for the secret. If the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key instead of the Amazon Web Services managed key in Secrets Manager, then the role also needs the kms:Decrypt permission for that key.  For SFTP connectors  Make sure that the access role provides read and write access to the parent directory of the file location that's used in the StartFileTransfer request. Additionally,  make sure that the role provides secretsmanager:GetSecretValue permission to Secrets Manager.

If you change the PassiveIp value, you must stop and then restart your Transfer Family server for the change to take effect. For details on using passive mode (PASV) in a NAT environment, see Configuring your FTPS server behind a firewall or NAT with Transfer Family.    Special values  The AUTO and 0.0.0.0 are special values for the PassiveIp parameter. The value PassiveIp=AUTO is assigned by default to FTP and FTPS type servers. In this case, the server automatically responds with one of the endpoint IPs within the PASV response. PassiveIp=0.0.0.0 has a more unique application for its usage. For example, if you have a High Availability (HA) Network Load Balancer (NLB) environment, where you have 3 subnets, you can only specify a single IP address using the PassiveIp parameter. This reduces the effectiveness of having High Availability. In this case, you can specify PassiveIp=0.0.0.0. This tells the client to use the same IP address as the Control connection and utilize all AZs for their connections. Note, however, that not all FTP clients support the PassiveIp=0.0.0.0 response. FileZilla and WinSCP do support it. If you are using other clients, check to see if your client supports the PassiveIp=0.0.0.0 response.

However, these commands are not compatible with object storage systems, such as Amazon S3. Due to this incompatibility, file uploads from these clients can result in errors even when  the file is otherwise successfully uploaded. Set the value to ENABLE_NO_OP to have the Transfer Family server ignore the SETSTAT command, and upload files without needing to make any changes to your SFTP client. While the SetStatOption ENABLE_NO_OP setting ignores the error, it does generate a log entry in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, so you can determine when the client is making a SETSTAT call.  If you want to preserve the original timestamp for your file, and modify other file attributes using SETSTAT, you can use Amazon EFS as backend storage with Transfer Family.
