Results are sorted by lastModifiedTime, starting with the most recent event.    When you call the DescribeEvents operation and specify an entity for the entityValues parameter, AWS Health might return public events that aren't specific to that resource. For example, if you call DescribeEvents and specify an ID for an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, AWS Health might return events that aren't specific to that resource or service. To get events that are specific to a service, use the services parameter in the filter object. For more information, see Event.   This API operation uses pagination.
