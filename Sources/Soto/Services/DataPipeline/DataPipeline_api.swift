/// Service object for interacting with AWS DataPipeline service.
///
/// AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow called a pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline  handles the details of scheduling and ensuring that data dependencies are met so that your application  can focus on processing the data.
///  AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR implementation of a task runner called AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner.  AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner provides logic for common data management scenarios, such as performing  database queries and running data analysis using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use  AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner as your task runner, or you can write your own task runner to provide  custom data management.  AWS Data Pipeline implements two main sets of functionality. Use the first set to create a pipeline  and define data sources, schedules, dependencies, and the transforms to be performed on the data.  Use the second set in your task runner application to receive the next task ready for processing.  The logic for performing the task, such as querying the data, running data analysis, or converting  the data from one format to another, is contained within the task runner. The task runner performs  the task assigned to it by the web service, reporting progress to the web service as it does so.  When the task is done, the task runner reports the final success or failure of the task to the web service.

For example, if the  first call to CreatePipeline does not succeed, you can pass in the same unique identifier and  pipeline name combination on a subsequent call to CreatePipeline. CreatePipeline  ensures that if a pipeline already exists with the same name and unique identifier, a new pipeline is not  created. Instead, you'll receive the pipeline identifier from the previous attempt. The uniqueness of the  name and unique identifier combination is scoped to the AWS account or IAM user credentials.

You can change this reporting time  from 15 minutes by specifying a reportProgressTimeout field in your pipeline.

    /// Task runners call ReportTaskProgress when assigned a task to acknowledge that it has the task. If the web service does not  receive this acknowledgement within 2 minutes, it assigns the task in a subsequent PollForTask call. After this initial acknowledgement,  the task runner only needs to report progress every 15 minutes to maintain its ownership of the task. You can change this reporting time  from 15 minutes by specifying a reportProgressTimeout field in your pipeline. If a task runner does not report its status after 5 minutes, AWS Data Pipeline assumes that the task runner is unable to process the task  and reassigns the task in a subsequent response to PollForTask. Task runners should call ReportTaskProgress every 60 seconds.
