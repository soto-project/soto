/// Service object for interacting with AWS DynamoDB service.

/// Amazon DynamoDB Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling. With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the Amazon Web Services Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics. DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region, providing built-in high availability and data durability.

    /// The BatchGetItem operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key. A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. BatchGetItem returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, more than 1MB per partition is requested, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for UnprocessedKeys. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get.  If you request more than 100 items, BatchGetItem returns a ValidationException with the message "Too many items requested for the BatchGetItem call."  For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate UnprocessedKeys value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset. If none of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then BatchGetItem returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. If at least one of the items is successfully processed, then BatchGetItem completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in UnprocessedKeys.  If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.  By default, BatchGetItem performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set ConsistentRead to true for any or all tables. In order to minimize response latency, BatchGetItem may retrieve items in parallel. When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the ProjectionExpression parameter. If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - requestItems: A map of one or more table names or table ARNs and, for each table, a map that describes one or more items to retrieve from that table. Each table name or ARN can be used only once per BatchGetItem request. Each element in the map of items to retrieve consists of the following:    ConsistentRead - If true, a strongly consistent read is used; if false (the default), an eventually consistent read is used.    ExpressionAttributeNames - One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in the ProjectionExpression parameter. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:    {"#P":"Percentile"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more information about expression attribute names, see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.    Keys - An array of primary key attribute values that define specific items in the table. For each primary key, you must provide all of the key attributes. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide the partition key value. For a composite key, you must provide both the partition key value and the sort key value.    ProjectionExpression - A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the table. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be separated by commas. If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes are returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they do not appear in the result. For more information, see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.    AttributesToGet - This is a legacy parameter. Use ProjectionExpression instead. For more information, see AttributesToGet in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

    /// The BatchWriteItem operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call to BatchWriteItem can transmit up to 16MB of data over the network, consisting of up to 25 item put or delete operations. While individual items can be up to 400 KB once stored, it's important to note that an item's representation might be greater than 400KB while being sent in DynamoDB's JSON format for the API call. For more details on this distinction, see Naming Rules and Data Types.   BatchWriteItem cannot update items. If you perform a BatchWriteItem operation on an existing item, that item's values will be overwritten by the operation and it will appear like it was updated. To update items, we recommend you use the UpdateItem action.  The individual PutItem and DeleteItem operations specified in BatchWriteItem are atomic; however BatchWriteItem as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the UnprocessedItems response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call BatchWriteItem in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new BatchWriteItem request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed. For tables and indexes with provisioned capacity, if none of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then BatchWriteItem returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. For all tables and indexes, if none of the items can be processed due to other throttling scenarios (such as exceeding partition level limits), then BatchWriteItem returns a ThrottlingException.  If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.  With BatchWriteItem, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations, BatchWriteItem does not behave in the same way as individual PutItem and DeleteItem calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and BatchWriteItem does not return deleted items in the response. If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations, BatchWriteItem performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application. Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit. If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:   One or more tables specified in the BatchWriteItem request does not exist.   Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.   You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same BatchWriteItem request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same BatchWriteItem request.    Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and range keys (which essentially is two put operations).    There are more than 25 requests in the batch.   Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.   The total request size exceeds 16 MB.   Any individual items with keys exceeding the key length limits. For a partition key, the limit is 2048 bytes and for a sort key, the limit is 1024 bytes.

The term "hash attribute" derives from the DynamoDB usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values. The sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.  For a simple primary key (partition key), you must provide exactly one element with a KeyType of HASH. For a composite primary key (partition key and sort key), you must provide exactly two elements, in this order: The first element must have a KeyType of HASH, and the second element must have a KeyType of RANGE.

The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:    {"#P":"Percentile"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - expressionAttributeValues: One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the following:   Available | Backordered | Discontinued  You would first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows:  { ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }  You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:  ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)  For more information on expression attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

    /// Returns the current provisioned-capacity quotas for your Amazon Web Services account in a Region, both for the Region as a whole and for any one DynamoDB table that you create there. When you establish an Amazon Web Services account, the account has initial quotas on the maximum read capacity units and write capacity units that you can provision across all of your DynamoDB tables in a given Region. Also, there are per-table quotas that apply when you create a table there. For more information, see Service, Account, and Table Quotas page in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. Although you can increase these quotas by filing a case at Amazon Web Services Support Center, obtaining the increase is not instantaneous. The DescribeLimits action lets you write code to compare the capacity you are currently using to those quotas imposed by your account so that you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a quota. For example, you could use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to do the following:   Call DescribeLimits for a particular Region to obtain your current account quotas on provisioned capacity there.   Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both.   Call ListTables to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables.   For each table name listed by ListTables, do the following:   Call DescribeTable with the table name.   Use the data returned by DescribeTable to add the read capacity units and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to your variables.   If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to your variables as well.     Report the account quotas for that Region returned by DescribeLimits, along with the total current provisioned capacity levels you have calculated.   This will let you see whether you are getting close to your account-level quotas. The per-table quotas apply only when you are creating a new table. They restrict the sum of the provisioned capacity of the new table itself and all its global secondary indexes. For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase provisioned capacity extremely rapidly, but the only quota that applies is that the aggregate provisioned capacity over all your tables and GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account quotas.   DescribeLimits should only be called periodically. You can expect throttling errors if you call it more than once in a minute.  The DescribeLimits Request element has no content.

For example, you could use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to do the following:   Call DescribeLimits for a particular Region to obtain your current account quotas on provisioned capacity there.   Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both.   Call ListTables to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables.   For each table name listed by ListTables, do the following:   Call DescribeTable with the table name.   Use the data returned by DescribeTable to add the read capacity units and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to your variables.   If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to your variables as well.     Report the account quotas for that Region returned by DescribeLimits, along with the total current provisioned capacity levels you have calculated.   This will let you see whether you are getting close to your account-level quotas. The per-table quotas apply only when you are creating a new table. They restrict the sum of the provisioned capacity of the new table itself and all its global secondary indexes. For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase provisioned capacity extremely rapidly, but the only quota that applies is that the aggregate provisioned capacity over all your tables and GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account quotas.   DescribeLimits should only be called periodically. You can expect throttling errors if you call it more than once in a minute.  The DescribeLimits Request element has no content.

    ///   - expressionAttributeNames: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:    {"#P":"Percentile"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - expressionAttributeValues: One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the following:   Available | Backordered | Discontinued  You would first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows:  { ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }  You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:  ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)  For more information on expression attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - item: A map of attribute name/value pairs, one for each attribute. Only the primary key attributes are required; you can optionally provide other attribute name-value pairs for the item. You must provide all of the attributes for the primary key. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide both values for both the partition key and the sort key. If you specify any attributes that are part of an index key, then the data types for those attributes must match those of the schema in the table's attribute definition. Empty String and Binary attribute values are allowed. Attribute values of type String and Binary must have a length greater than zero if the attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or index.

The condition must perform an equality test on a single partition key value. The condition can optionally perform one of several comparison tests on a single sort key value. This allows Query to retrieve one item with a given partition key value and sort key value, or several items that have the same partition key value but different sort key values. The partition key equality test is required, and must be specified in the following format:  partitionKeyName = :partitionkeyval  If you also want to provide a condition for the sort key, it must be combined using AND with the condition for the sort key. Following is an example, using the = comparison operator for the sort key:  partitionKeyName = :partitionkeyval AND sortKeyName = :sortkeyval  Valid comparisons for the sort key condition are as follows:    sortKeyName = :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is equal to :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName  :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less than :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName  :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less than or equal to :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName > :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName >=  :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName BETWEEN :sortkeyval1 AND :sortkeyval2 - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval1, and less than or equal to :sortkeyval2.    begins_with ( sortKeyName, :sortkeyval ) - true if the sort key value begins with a particular operand. (You cannot use this function with a sort key that is of type Number.) Note that the function name begins_with is case-sensitive.   Use the ExpressionAttributeValues parameter to replace tokens such as :partitionval and :sortval with actual values at runtime. You can optionally use the ExpressionAttributeNames parameter to replace the names of the partition key and sort key with placeholder tokens. This option might be necessary if an attribute name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word. For example, the following KeyConditionExpression parameter causes an error because Size is a reserved word:    Size = :myval    To work around this, define a placeholder (such a #S) to represent the attribute name Size. KeyConditionExpression then is as follows:    #S = :myval    For a list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

    ///   - limit: The maximum number of items to evaluate (not necessarily the number of matching items). If DynamoDB processes the number of items up to the limit while processing the results, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to that point, and a key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation, so that you can pick up where you left off. Also, if the processed dataset size exceeds 1 MB before DynamoDB reaches this limit, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to the limit, and a key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation to continue the operation. For more information, see Query and Scan in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - projectionExpression: A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the table. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be separated by commas. If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they will not appear in the result. For more information, see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - queryFilter: This is a legacy parameter. Use FilterExpression instead. For more information, see QueryFilter in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - returnConsumedCapacity: 
    ///   - scanIndexForward: Specifies the order for index traversal: If true (default), the traversal is performed in ascending order; if false, the traversal is performed in descending order.  Items with the same partition key value are stored in sorted order by sort key. If the sort key data type is Number, the results are stored in numeric order. For type String, the results are stored in order of UTF-8 bytes. For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned. If ScanIndexForward is true, DynamoDB returns the results in the order in which they are stored (by sort key value). This is the default behavior. If ScanIndexForward is false, DynamoDB reads the results in reverse order by sort key value, and then returns the results to the client.
    ///   - select: The attributes to be returned in the result. You can retrieve all item attributes, specific item attributes, the count of matching items, or in the case of an index, some or all of the attributes projected into the index.    ALL_ATTRIBUTES - Returns all of the item attributes from the specified table or index. If you query a local secondary index, then for each matching item in the index, DynamoDB fetches the entire item from the parent table. If the index is configured to project all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required.    ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES - Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index. If the index is configured to project all attributes, this return value is equivalent to specifying ALL_ATTRIBUTES.    COUNT - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves. Note that this uses the same quantity of read capacity units as getting the items, and is subject to the same item size calculations.    SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES - Returns only the attributes listed in ProjectionExpression. This return value is equivalent to specifying ProjectionExpression without specifying any value for Select. If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation will read only the index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB fetches each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency. If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent table.   If neither Select nor ProjectionExpression are specified, DynamoDB defaults to ALL_ATTRIBUTES when accessing a table, and ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES when accessing an index. You cannot use both Select and ProjectionExpression together in a single request, unless the value for Select is SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. (This usage is equivalent to specifying ProjectionExpression without any value for Select.)  If you use the ProjectionExpression parameter, then the value for Select can only be SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. Any other value for Select will return an error.

    /// The Scan operation returns one or more items and item attributes by accessing every item in a table or a secondary index. To have DynamoDB return fewer items, you can provide a FilterExpression operation. If the total size of scanned items exceeds the maximum dataset size limit of 1 MB, the scan completes and results are returned to the user. The LastEvaluatedKey value is also returned and the requestor can use the LastEvaluatedKey to continue the scan in a subsequent operation. Each scan response also includes number of items that were scanned (ScannedCount) as part of the request. If using a FilterExpression, a scan result can result in no items meeting the criteria and the Count will result in zero. If you did not use a FilterExpression in the scan request, then Count is the same as ScannedCount.   Count and ScannedCount only return the count of items specific to a single scan request and, unless the table is less than 1MB, do not represent the total number of items in the table.   A single Scan operation first reads up to the maximum number of items set (if using the Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then applies any filtering to the results if a FilterExpression is provided. If LastEvaluatedKey is present in the response, pagination is required to complete the full table scan. For more information, see Paginating the Results in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.  Scan operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster performance on a large table or secondary index, applications can request a parallel Scan operation by providing the Segment and TotalSegments parameters. For more information, see Parallel Scan in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. By default, a Scan uses eventually consistent reads when accessing the items in a table. Therefore, the results from an eventually consistent Scan may not include the latest item changes at the time the scan iterates through each item in the table. If you require a strongly consistent read of each item as the scan iterates through the items in the table, you can set the ConsistentRead parameter to true. Strong consistency only relates to the consistency of the read at the item level.  DynamoDB does not provide snapshot isolation for a scan operation when the ConsistentRead parameter is set to true. Thus, a DynamoDB scan operation does not guarantee that all reads in a scan see a consistent snapshot of the table when the scan operation was requested.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - attributesToGet: This is a legacy parameter. Use ProjectionExpression instead. For more information, see AttributesToGet in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - conditionalOperator: This is a legacy parameter. Use FilterExpression instead. For more information, see ConditionalOperator in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - consistentRead: A Boolean value that determines the read consistency model during the scan:   If ConsistentRead is false, then the data returned from Scan might not contain the results from other recently completed write operations (PutItem, UpdateItem, or DeleteItem).   If ConsistentRead is true, then all of the write operations that completed before the Scan began are guaranteed to be contained in the Scan response.   The default setting for ConsistentRead is false. The ConsistentRead parameter is not supported on global secondary indexes. If you scan a global secondary index with ConsistentRead set to true, you will receive a ValidationException.
    ///   - exclusiveStartKey: The primary key of the first item that this operation will evaluate. Use the value that was returned for LastEvaluatedKey in the previous operation. The data type for ExclusiveStartKey must be String, Number or Binary. No set data types are allowed. In a parallel scan, a Scan request that includes ExclusiveStartKey must specify the same segment whose previous Scan returned the corresponding value of LastEvaluatedKey.
    ///   - expressionAttributeNames: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:    {"#P":"Percentile"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - expressionAttributeValues: One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the following:   Available | Backordered | Discontinued  You would first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows:  { ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }  You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:  ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)  For more information on expression attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - filterExpression: A string that contains conditions that DynamoDB applies after the Scan operation, but before the data is returned to you. Items that do not satisfy the FilterExpression criteria are not returned.  A FilterExpression is applied after the items have already been read; the process of filtering does not consume any additional read capacity units.  For more information, see Filter Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - indexName: The name of a secondary index to scan. This index can be any local secondary index or global secondary index. Note that if you use the IndexName parameter, you must also provide TableName.
    ///   - limit: The maximum number of items to evaluate (not necessarily the number of matching items). If DynamoDB processes the number of items up to the limit while processing the results, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to that point, and a key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation, so that you can pick up where you left off. Also, if the processed dataset size exceeds 1 MB before DynamoDB reaches this limit, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to the limit, and a key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation to continue the operation. For more information, see Working with Queries in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - projectionExpression: A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the specified table or index. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be separated by commas. If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they will not appear in the result. For more information, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - returnConsumedCapacity: 
    ///   - scanFilter: This is a legacy parameter. Use FilterExpression instead. For more information, see ScanFilter in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - segment: For a parallel Scan request, Segment identifies an individual segment to be scanned by an application worker. Segment IDs are zero-based, so the first segment is always 0. For example, if you want to use four application threads to scan a table or an index, then the first thread specifies a Segment value of 0, the second thread specifies 1, and so on. The value of LastEvaluatedKey returned from a parallel Scan request must be used as ExclusiveStartKey with the same segment ID in a subsequent Scan operation. The value for Segment must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than the value provided for TotalSegments. If you provide Segment, you must also provide TotalSegments.
    ///   - select: The attributes to be returned in the result. You can retrieve all item attributes, specific item attributes, the count of matching items, or in the case of an index, some or all of the attributes projected into the index.    ALL_ATTRIBUTES - Returns all of the item attributes from the specified table or index. If you query a local secondary index, then for each matching item in the index, DynamoDB fetches the entire item from the parent table. If the index is configured to project all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required.    ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES - Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index. If the index is configured to project all attributes, this return value is equivalent to specifying ALL_ATTRIBUTES.    COUNT - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves. Note that this uses the same quantity of read capacity units as getting the items, and is subject to the same item size calculations.    SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES - Returns only the attributes listed in ProjectionExpression. This return value is equivalent to specifying ProjectionExpression without specifying any value for Select. If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation reads only the index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB fetches each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency. If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent table.   If neither Select nor ProjectionExpression are specified, DynamoDB defaults to ALL_ATTRIBUTES when accessing a table, and ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES when accessing an index. You cannot use both Select and ProjectionExpression together in a single request, unless the value for Select is SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. (This usage is equivalent to specifying ProjectionExpression without any value for Select.)  If you use the ProjectionExpression parameter, then the value for Select can only be SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. Any other value for Select will return an error.
    ///   - tableName: The name of the table containing the requested items or if you provide IndexName, the name of the table to which that index belongs. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter.
    ///   - totalSegments: For a parallel Scan request, TotalSegments represents the total number of segments into which the Scan operation will be divided. The value of TotalSegments corresponds to the number of application workers that will perform the parallel scan. For example, if you want to use four application threads to scan a table or an index, specify a TotalSegments value of 4. The value for TotalSegments must be greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to 1000000. If you specify a TotalSegments value of 1, the Scan operation will be sequential rather than parallel. If you specify TotalSegments, you must also specify Segment.

If you issue a ListTagsOfResource request immediately after a TagResource request, DynamoDB might return your previous tag set, if there was one, or an empty tag set. This is because ListTagsOfResource uses an eventually consistent query, and the metadata for your tags or table might not be available at that moment. Wait for a few seconds, and then try the ListTagsOfResource request again.   The application or removal of tags using TagResource and UntagResource APIs is eventually consistent. ListTagsOfResource API will only reflect the changes after a few seconds.   For an overview on tagging DynamoDB resources, see Tagging for DynamoDB in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

Although multiple identical calls using the same client request token produce the same result on the server (no side effects), the responses to the calls might not be the same. If the ReturnConsumedCapacity parameter is set, then the initial TransactWriteItems call returns the amount of write capacity units consumed in making the changes.

Do not resubmit the same request with the same client token for more than 10 minutes, or the result might not be idempotent. If you submit a request with the same client token but a change in other parameters within the 10-minute idempotency window, DynamoDB returns an IdempotentParameterMismatch exception.

    ///   - conditionExpression: A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional update to succeed. An expression can contain any of the following:   Functions: attribute_exists | attribute_not_exists | attribute_type | contains | begins_with | size  These function names are case-sensitive.   Comparison operators: = | <> | | = | BETWEEN | IN     Logical operators: AND | OR | NOT    For more information about condition expressions, see Specifying Conditions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - expected: This is a legacy parameter. Use ConditionExpression instead. For more information, see Expected in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - expressionAttributeNames: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.) To work around this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:    {"#P":"Percentile"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more information about expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - expressionAttributeValues: One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the following:   Available | Backordered | Discontinued  You would first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows:  { ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }  You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:  ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)  For more information on expression attribute values, see Condition Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - key: The primary key of the item to be updated. Each element consists of an attribute name and a value for that attribute. For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide values for both the partition key and the sort key.
    ///   - returnConsumedCapacity: 
    ///   - returnItemCollectionMetrics: Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If set to SIZE, the response includes statistics about item collections, if any, that were modified during the operation are returned in the response. If set to NONE (the default), no statistics are returned.
    ///   - returnValues: Use ReturnValues if you want to get the item attributes as they appear before or after they are successfully updated. For UpdateItem, the valid values are:    NONE - If ReturnValues is not specified, or if its value is NONE, then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for ReturnValues.)    ALL_OLD - Returns all of the attributes of the item, as they appeared before the UpdateItem operation.    UPDATED_OLD - Returns only the updated attributes, as they appeared before the UpdateItem operation.    ALL_NEW - Returns all of the attributes of the item, as they appear after the UpdateItem operation.    UPDATED_NEW - Returns only the updated attributes, as they appear after the UpdateItem operation.   There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed. The values returned are strongly consistent.
    ///   - returnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure: An optional parameter that returns the item attributes for an UpdateItem operation that failed a condition check. There is no additional cost associated with requesting a return value aside from the small network and processing overhead of receiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.
    ///   - tableName: The name of the table containing the item to update. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter.
    ///   - updateExpression: An expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated, the action to be performed on them, and new values for them. The following action values are available for UpdateExpression.    SET - Adds one or more attributes and values to an item. If any of these attributes already exist, they are replaced by the new values. You can also use SET to add or subtract from an attribute that is of type Number. For example: SET myNum = myNum + :val   SET supports the following functions:    if_not_exists (path, operand) - if the item does not contain an attribute at the specified path, then if_not_exists evaluates to operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this function to avoid overwriting an attribute that may already be present in the item.    list_append (operand, operand) - evaluates to a list with a new element added to it. You can append the new element to the start or the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands.   These function names are case-sensitive.    REMOVE - Removes one or more attributes from an item.    ADD - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute does not already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior of ADD depends on the data type of the attribute:   If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value is also a number, then Value is mathematically added to the existing attribute. If Value is a negative number, then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.  If you use ADD to increment or decrement a number value for an item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value. Similarly, if you use ADD for an existing item to increment or decrement an attribute value that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value. For example, suppose that the item you want to update doesn't have an attribute named itemcount, but you decide to ADD the number 3 to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB will create the itemcount attribute, set its initial value to 0, and finally add 3 to it. The result will be a new itemcount attribute in the item, with a value of 3.    If the existing data type is a set and if Value is also a set, then Value is added to the existing set. For example, if the attribute value is the set [1,2], and the ADD action specified [3], then the final attribute value is [1,2,3]. An error occurs if an ADD action is specified for a set attribute and the attribute type specified does not match the existing set type.  Both sets must have the same primitive data type. For example, if the existing data type is a set of strings, the Value must also be a set of strings.    The ADD action only supports Number and set data types. In addition, ADD can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes.     DELETE - Deletes an element from a set. If a set of values is specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set. For example, if the attribute value was the set [a,b,c] and the DELETE action specifies [a,c], then the final attribute value is [b]. Specifying an empty set is an error.  The DELETE action only supports set data types. In addition, DELETE can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested attributes.    You can have many actions in a single expression, such as the following: SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, :value5  For more information on update expressions, see Modifying Items and Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

DynamoDB deletes expired items on a best-effort basis to ensure availability of throughput for other data operations.   DynamoDB typically deletes expired items within two days of expiration. The exact duration within which an item gets deleted after expiration is specific to the nature of the workload. Items that have expired and not been deleted will still show up in reads, queries, and scans.  As items are deleted, they are removed from any local secondary index and global secondary index immediately in the same eventually consistent way as a standard delete operation.

Strongly consistent reads are not supported on global secondary indexes. If you query a global secondary index with ConsistentRead set to true, you will receive a ValidationException.
    ///   - exclusiveStartKey: The primary key of the first item that this operation will evaluate. Use the value that was returned for LastEvaluatedKey in the previous operation. The data type for ExclusiveStartKey must be String, Number, or Binary. No set data types are allowed.
    ///   - expressionAttributeNames: One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an expression. The following are some use cases for using ExpressionAttributeNames:   To access an attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word.   To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an attribute name in an expression.   To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being misinterpreted in an expression.   Use the # character in an expression to dereference an attribute name. For example, consider the following attribute name:    Percentile    The name of this attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide). To work around this, you could specify the following for ExpressionAttributeNames:    {"#P":"Percentile"}    You could then use this substitution in an expression, as in this example:    #P = :val     Tokens that begin with the : character are expression attribute values, which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.  For more information on expression attribute names, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - expressionAttributeValues: One or more values that can be substituted in an expression. Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference an attribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the following:   Available | Backordered | Discontinued  You would first need to specify ExpressionAttributeValues as follows:  { ":avail":{"S":"Available"}, ":back":{"S":"Backordered"}, ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }  You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:  ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)  For more information on expression attribute values, see Specifying Conditions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - filterExpression: A string that contains conditions that DynamoDB applies after the Query operation, but before the data is returned to you. Items that do not satisfy the FilterExpression criteria are not returned. A FilterExpression does not allow key attributes. You cannot define a filter expression based on a partition key or a sort key.  A FilterExpression is applied after the items have already been read; the process of filtering does not consume any additional read capacity units.  For more information, see Filter Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - indexName: The name of an index to query. This index can be any local secondary index or global secondary index on the table. Note that if you use the IndexName parameter, you must also provide TableName.
    ///   - keyConditionExpression: The condition that specifies the key values for items to be retrieved by the Query action. The condition must perform an equality test on a single partition key value. The condition can optionally perform one of several comparison tests on a single sort key value. This allows Query to retrieve one item with a given partition key value and sort key value, or several items that have the same partition key value but different sort key values. The partition key equality test is required, and must be specified in the following format:  partitionKeyName = :partitionkeyval  If you also want to provide a condition for the sort key, it must be combined using AND with the condition for the sort key. Following is an example, using the = comparison operator for the sort key:  partitionKeyName = :partitionkeyval AND sortKeyName = :sortkeyval  Valid comparisons for the sort key condition are as follows:    sortKeyName = :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is equal to :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName  :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less than :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName  :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less than or equal to :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName > :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName >=  :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval.    sortKeyName BETWEEN :sortkeyval1 AND :sortkeyval2 - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval1, and less than or equal to :sortkeyval2.    begins_with ( sortKeyName, :sortkeyval ) - true if the sort key value begins with a particular operand. (You cannot use this function with a sort key that is of type Number.) Note that the function name begins_with is case-sensitive.   Use the ExpressionAttributeValues parameter to replace tokens such as :partitionval and :sortval with actual values at runtime. You can optionally use the ExpressionAttributeNames parameter to replace the names of the partition key and sort key with placeholder tokens. This option might be necessary if an attribute name conflicts with a DynamoDB reserved word. For example, the following KeyConditionExpression parameter causes an error because Size is a reserved word:    Size = :myval    To work around this, define a placeholder (such a #S) to represent the attribute name Size. KeyConditionExpression then is as follows:    #S = :myval    For a list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. For more information on ExpressionAttributeNames and ExpressionAttributeValues, see Using Placeholders for Attribute Names and Values in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - keyConditions: This is a legacy parameter. Use KeyConditionExpression instead. For more information, see KeyConditions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - limit: The maximum number of items to evaluate (not necessarily the number of matching items). If DynamoDB processes the number of items up to the limit while processing the results, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to that point, and a key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation, so that you can pick up where you left off. Also, if the processed dataset size exceeds 1 MB before DynamoDB reaches this limit, it stops the operation and returns the matching values up to the limit, and a key in LastEvaluatedKey to apply in a subsequent operation to continue the operation. For more information, see Query and Scan in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - projectionExpression: A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the table. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be separated by commas. If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be returned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they will not appear in the result. For more information, see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - queryFilter: This is a legacy parameter. Use FilterExpression instead. For more information, see QueryFilter in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    ///   - returnConsumedCapacity: 
    ///   - scanIndexForward: Specifies the order for index traversal: If true (default), the traversal is performed in ascending order; if false, the traversal is performed in descending order.  Items with the same partition key value are stored in sorted order by sort key. If the sort key data type is Number, the results are stored in numeric order. For type String, the results are stored in order of UTF-8 bytes. For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as unsigned. If ScanIndexForward is true, DynamoDB returns the results in the order in which they are stored (by sort key value). This is the default behavior. If ScanIndexForward is false, DynamoDB reads the results in reverse order by sort key value, and then returns the results to the client.
    ///   - select: The attributes to be returned in the result. You can retrieve all item attributes, specific item attributes, the count of matching items, or in the case of an index, some or all of the attributes projected into the index.    ALL_ATTRIBUTES - Returns all of the item attributes from the specified table or index. If you query a local secondary index, then for each matching item in the index, DynamoDB fetches the entire item from the parent table. If the index is configured to project all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required.    ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES - Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index. If the index is configured to project all attributes, this return value is equivalent to specifying ALL_ATTRIBUTES.    COUNT - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves. Note that this uses the same quantity of read capacity units as getting the items, and is subject to the same item size calculations.    SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES - Returns only the attributes listed in ProjectionExpression. This return value is equivalent to specifying ProjectionExpression without specifying any value for Select. If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation will read only the index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB fetches each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency. If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent table.   If neither Select nor ProjectionExpression are specified, DynamoDB defaults to ALL_ATTRIBUTES when accessing a table, and ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES when accessing an index. You cannot use both Select and ProjectionExpression together in a single request, unless the value for Select is SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. (This usage is equivalent to specifying ProjectionExpression without any value for Select.)  If you use the ProjectionExpression parameter, then the value for Select can only be SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. Any other value for Select will return an error.

    ///   - segment: For a parallel Scan request, Segment identifies an individual segment to be scanned by an application worker. Segment IDs are zero-based, so the first segment is always 0. For example, if you want to use four application threads to scan a table or an index, then the first thread specifies a Segment value of 0, the second thread specifies 1, and so on. The value of LastEvaluatedKey returned from a parallel Scan request must be used as ExclusiveStartKey with the same segment ID in a subsequent Scan operation. The value for Segment must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than the value provided for TotalSegments. If you provide Segment, you must also provide TotalSegments.
    ///   - select: The attributes to be returned in the result. You can retrieve all item attributes, specific item attributes, the count of matching items, or in the case of an index, some or all of the attributes projected into the index.    ALL_ATTRIBUTES - Returns all of the item attributes from the specified table or index. If you query a local secondary index, then for each matching item in the index, DynamoDB fetches the entire item from the parent table. If the index is configured to project all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the local secondary index, and no fetching is required.    ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES - Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the index. If the index is configured to project all attributes, this return value is equivalent to specifying ALL_ATTRIBUTES.    COUNT - Returns the number of matching items, rather than the matching items themselves. Note that this uses the same quantity of read capacity units as getting the items, and is subject to the same item size calculations.    SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES - Returns only the attributes listed in ProjectionExpression. This return value is equivalent to specifying ProjectionExpression without specifying any value for Select. If you query or scan a local secondary index and request only attributes that are projected into that index, the operation reads only the index and not the table. If any of the requested attributes are not projected into the local secondary index, DynamoDB fetches each of these attributes from the parent table. This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency. If you query or scan a global secondary index, you can only request attributes that are projected into the index. Global secondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent table.   If neither Select nor ProjectionExpression are specified, DynamoDB defaults to ALL_ATTRIBUTES when accessing a table, and ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES when accessing an index. You cannot use both Select and ProjectionExpression together in a single request, unless the value for Select is SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. (This usage is equivalent to specifying ProjectionExpression without any value for Select.)  If you use the ProjectionExpression parameter, then the value for Select can only be SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES. Any other value for Select will return an error.
    ///   - tableName: The name of the table containing the requested items or if you provide IndexName, the name of the table to which that index belongs. You can also provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter.
    ///   - totalSegments: For a parallel Scan request, TotalSegments represents the total number of segments into which the Scan operation will be divided. The value of TotalSegments corresponds to the number of application workers that will perform the parallel scan. For example, if you want to use four application threads to scan a table or an index, specify a TotalSegments value of 4. The value for TotalSegments must be greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to 1000000. If you specify a TotalSegments value of 1, the Scan operation will be sequential rather than parallel. If you specify TotalSegments, you must also specify Segment.
