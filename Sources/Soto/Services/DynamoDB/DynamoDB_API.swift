/// Service object for interacting with AWS DynamoDB service.

/// Amazon DynamoDB Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling. With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the AWS Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics. DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS region, providing built-in high availability and data durability.

    ///  This operation allows you to perform batch reads and writes on data stored in DynamoDB, using PartiQL.
    public func batchExecuteStatement(_ input: BatchExecuteStatementInput, logger: Logger = AWSClient.loggingDisabled, on eventLoop: EventLoop? = nil) -> EventLoopFuture<BatchExecuteStatementOutput> {
        return self.client.execute(operation: "BatchExecuteStatement", path: "/", httpMethod: .POST, serviceConfig: self.config, input: input, logger: logger, on: eventLoop)
    }

    /// The BatchGetItem operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key. A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. BatchGetItem returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for UnprocessedKeys. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get.  If you request more than 100 items, BatchGetItem returns a ValidationException with the message "Too many items requested for the BatchGetItem call."  For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate UnprocessedKeys value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset. If none of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then BatchGetItem returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. If at least one of the items is successfully processed, then BatchGetItem completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in UnprocessedKeys.  If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.  By default, BatchGetItem performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set ConsistentRead to true for any or all tables. In order to minimize response latency, BatchGetItem retrieves items in parallel. When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the ProjectionExpression parameter. If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read. For more information, see Working with Tables in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.
    public func batchGetItem(_ input: BatchGetItemInput, logger: Logger = AWSClient.loggingDisabled, on eventLoop: EventLoop? = nil) -> EventLoopFuture<BatchGetItemOutput> {
        return self.client.execute(operation: "BatchGetItem", path: "/", httpMethod: .POST, serviceConfig: self.config, input: input, logger: logger, on: eventLoop)
    }

    /// The BatchWriteItem operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call to BatchWriteItem can write up to 16 MB of data, which can comprise as many as 25 put or delete requests. Individual items to be written can be as large as 400 KB.   BatchWriteItem cannot update items. To update items, use the UpdateItem action.  The individual PutItem and DeleteItem operations specified in BatchWriteItem are atomic; however BatchWriteItem as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the UnprocessedItems response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call BatchWriteItem in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new BatchWriteItem request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed. If none of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then BatchWriteItem returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException.  If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.  With BatchWriteItem, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations, BatchWriteItem does not behave in the same way as individual PutItem and DeleteItem calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and BatchWriteItem does not return deleted items in the response. If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations, BatchWriteItem performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application. Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit. If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:   One or more tables specified in the BatchWriteItem request does not exist.   Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.   You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same BatchWriteItem request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same BatchWriteItem request.     Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and range keys (which essentially is two put operations).    There are more than 25 requests in the batch.   Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.   The total request size exceeds 16 MB.
    public func batchWriteItem(_ input: BatchWriteItemInput, logger: Logger = AWSClient.loggingDisabled, on eventLoop: EventLoop? = nil) -> EventLoopFuture<BatchWriteItemOutput> {

    /// Creates a backup for an existing table.  Each time you create an on-demand backup, the entire table data is backed up. There is no limit to the number of on-demand backups that can be taken.   When you create an on-demand backup, a time marker of the request is cataloged, and the backup is created asynchronously, by applying all changes until the time of the request to the last full table snapshot. Backup requests are processed instantaneously and become available for restore within minutes.  You can call CreateBackup at a maximum rate of 50 times per second. All backups in DynamoDB work without consuming any provisioned throughput on the table.  If you submit a backup request on 2018-12-14 at 14:25:00, the backup is guaranteed to contain all data committed to the table up to 14:24:00, and data committed after 14:26:00 will not be. The backup might contain data modifications made between 14:24:00 and 14:26:00. On-demand backup does not support causal consistency.

This operation only applies to Version 2017.11.29 of global tables.  If you want to add a new replica table to a global table, each of the following conditions must be true:   The table must have the same primary key as all of the other replicas.   The table must have the same name as all of the other replicas.   The table must have DynamoDB Streams enabled, with the stream containing both the new and the old images of the item.   None of the replica tables in the global table can contain any data.    If global secondary indexes are specified, then the following conditions must also be met:     The global secondary indexes must have the same name.     The global secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort key (if present).     If local secondary indexes are specified, then the following conditions must also be met:     The local secondary indexes must have the same name.     The local secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort key (if present).      Write capacity settings should be set consistently across your replica tables and secondary indexes. DynamoDB strongly recommends enabling auto scaling to manage the write capacity settings for all of your global tables replicas and indexes.   If you prefer to manage write capacity settings manually, you should provision equal replicated write capacity units to your replica tables. You should also provision equal replicated write capacity units to matching secondary indexes across your global table.

Upon receiving a CreateTable request, DynamoDB immediately returns a response with a TableStatus of CREATING. After the table is created, DynamoDB sets the TableStatus to ACTIVE. You can perform read and write operations only on an ACTIVE table.  You can optionally define secondary indexes on the new table, as part of the CreateTable operation. If you want to create multiple tables with secondary indexes on them, you must create the tables sequentially. Only one table with secondary indexes can be in the CREATING state at any given time.

Unless you specify conditions, the DeleteItem is an idempotent operation; running it multiple times on the same item or attribute does not result in an error response.

DynamoDB might continue to accept data read and write operations, such as GetItem and PutItem, on a table in the DELETING state until the table deletion is complete.

When you establish an AWS account, the account has initial quotas on the maximum read capacity units and write capacity units that you can provision across all of your DynamoDB tables in a given Region. Also, there are per-table quotas that apply when you create a table there. For more information, see Service, Account, and Table Quotas page in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. Although you can increase these quotas by filing a case at AWS Support Center, obtaining the increase is not instantaneous. The DescribeLimits action lets you write code to compare the capacity you are currently using to those quotas imposed by your account so that you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a quota. For example, you could use one of the AWS SDKs to do the following:   Call DescribeLimits for a particular Region to obtain your current account quotas on provisioned capacity there.   Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both.   Call ListTables to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables.   For each table name listed by ListTables, do the following:   Call DescribeTable with the table name.   Use the data returned by DescribeTable to add the read capacity units and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to your variables.   If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to your variables as well.     Report the account quotas for that Region returned by DescribeLimits, along with the total current provisioned capacity levels you have calculated.   This will let you see whether you are getting close to your account-level quotas. The per-table quotas apply only when you are creating a new table. They restrict the sum of the provisioned capacity of the new table itself and all its global secondary indexes. For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase provisioned capacity extremely rapidly, but the only quota that applies is that the aggregate provisioned capacity over all your tables and GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account quotas.   DescribeLimits should only be called periodically. You can expect throttling errors if you call it more than once in a minute.  The DescribeLimits Request element has no content.

    /// Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item. If an item that has the same primary key as the new item already exists in the specified table, the new item completely replaces the existing item. You can perform a conditional put operation (add a new item if one with the specified primary key doesn't exist), or replace an existing item if it has certain attribute values. You can return the item's attribute values in the same operation, using the ReturnValues parameter.  This topic provides general information about the PutItem API. For information on how to call the PutItem API using the AWS SDK in specific languages, see the following:     PutItem in the AWS Command Line Interface      PutItem in the AWS SDK for .NET      PutItem in the AWS SDK for C++      PutItem in the AWS SDK for Go      PutItem in the AWS SDK for Java      PutItem in the AWS SDK for JavaScript      PutItem in the AWS SDK for PHP V3      PutItem in the AWS SDK for Python      PutItem in the AWS SDK for Ruby V2     When you add an item, the primary key attributes are the only required attributes. Attribute values cannot be null. Empty String and Binary attribute values are allowed. Attribute values of type String and Binary must have a length greater than zero if the attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or index. Set type attributes cannot be empty.  Invalid Requests with empty values will be rejected with a ValidationException exception.  To prevent a new item from replacing an existing item, use a conditional expression that contains the attribute_not_exists function with the name of the attribute being used as the partition key for the table. Since every record must contain that attribute, the attribute_not_exists function will only succeed if no matching item exists.  For more information about PutItem, see Working with Items in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

    /// The Query operation finds items based on primary key values. You can query any table or secondary index that has a composite primary key (a partition key and a sort key).  Use the KeyConditionExpression parameter to provide a specific value for the partition key. The Query operation will return all of the items from the table or index with that partition key value. You can optionally narrow the scope of the Query operation by specifying a sort key value and a comparison operator in KeyConditionExpression. To further refine the Query results, you can optionally provide a FilterExpression. A FilterExpression determines which items within the results should be returned to you. All of the other results are discarded.   A Query operation always returns a result set. If no matching items are found, the result set will be empty. Queries that do not return results consume the minimum number of read capacity units for that type of read operation.    DynamoDB calculates the number of read capacity units consumed based on item size, not on the amount of data that is returned to an application. The number of capacity units consumed will be the same whether you request all of the attributes (the default behavior) or just some of them (using a projection expression). The number will also be the same whether or not you use a FilterExpression.    Query results are always sorted by the sort key value. If the data type of the sort key is Number, the results are returned in numeric order; otherwise, the results are returned in order of UTF-8 bytes. By default, the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, set the ScanIndexForward parameter to false.   A single Query operation will read up to the maximum number of items set (if using the Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then apply any filtering to the results using FilterExpression. If LastEvaluatedKey is present in the response, you will need to paginate the result set. For more information, see Paginating the Results in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.   FilterExpression is applied after a Query finishes, but before the results are returned. A FilterExpression cannot contain partition key or sort key attributes. You need to specify those attributes in the KeyConditionExpression.    A Query operation can return an empty result set and a LastEvaluatedKey if all the items read for the page of results are filtered out.   You can query a table, a local secondary index, or a global secondary index. For a query on a table or on a local secondary index, you can set the ConsistentRead parameter to true and obtain a strongly consistent result. Global secondary indexes support eventually consistent reads only, so do not specify ConsistentRead when querying a global secondary index.
