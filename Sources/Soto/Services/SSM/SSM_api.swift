    /// Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your automations, documents, managed nodes, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed nodes that helps you track each node's owner and stack level. For example:    Key=Owner,Value=DbAdmin     Key=Owner,Value=SysAdmin     Key=Owner,Value=Dev     Key=Stack,Value=Production     Key=Stack,Value=Pre-Production     Key=Stack,Value=Test    Most resources can have a maximum of 50 tags. Automations can have a maximum of 5 tags. We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters. For more information about using tags with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, see Tag your Amazon EC2 resources in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

Specify true for ApplyOnlyAtCronIntervalif you want the association to run only according to the schedule you specified. For more information, see Understanding when associations are applied to resources and >About target updates with Automation runbooks in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions.
    ///   - associationName: Specify a descriptive name for the association.
    ///   - automationTargetParameterName: Choose the parameter that will define how your automation will branch out. This target is required for associations that use an Automation runbook and target resources by using rate controls. Automation is a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.
    ///   - calendarNames: The names of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar type documents you want to gate your associations under. The associations only run when that change calendar is open. For more information, see Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Calendar in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.
    ///   - complianceSeverity: The severity level to assign to the association.
    ///   - documentVersion: The document version you want to associate with the targets. Can be a specific version or the default version.  State Manager doesn't support running associations that use a new version of a document if that document is shared from another account. State Manager always runs the default version of a document if shared from another account, even though the Systems Manager console shows that a new version was processed. If you want to run an association using a new version of a document shared form another account, you must set the document version to default.
    ///   - duration: The number of hours the association can run before it is canceled. Duration applies to associations that are currently running, and any pending and in progress commands on all targets. If a target was taken offline for the association to run, it is made available again immediately, without a reboot.  The Duration parameter applies only when both these conditions are true:   The association for which you specify a duration is cancelable according to the parameters of the SSM command document or Automation runbook associated with this execution.    The command specifies the  ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval parameter, which means that the association doesn't run immediately after it is created, but only according to the specified schedule.
    ///   - instanceId: The managed node ID.   InstanceId has been deprecated. To specify a managed node ID for an association, use the Targets parameter. Requests that include the parameter InstanceID with Systems Manager documents (SSM documents) that use schema version 2.0 or later will fail. In addition, if you use the parameter InstanceId, you can't use the parameters AssociationName, DocumentVersion, MaxErrors, MaxConcurrency, OutputLocation, or ScheduleExpression. To use these parameters, you must use the Targets parameter.
    ///   - maxConcurrency: The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time. If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while Systems Manager is running MaxConcurrency associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new managed node will process its association within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency.
    ///   - maxErrors: The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set MaxError to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received. Executions that are already running an association when MaxErrors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well.

    ///   - name: The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that contains the configuration information for the managed node. You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from another Amazon Web Services account. For Systems Manager documents (SSM documents) that are shared with you from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:  arn:partition:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name   For example:  arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document  For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For example, AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline or My-Document.
    ///   - outputLocation: An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket where you want to store the output details of the request.
    ///   - parameters: The parameters for the runtime configuration of the document.
    ///   - scheduleExpression: A cron expression when the association will be applied to the targets.
    ///   - scheduleOffset: Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an association. For example, if you specified a cron schedule of cron(0 0 ? * THU#2 *), you could specify an offset of 3 to run the association each Sunday after the second Thursday of the month. For more information about cron schedules for associations, see Reference: Cron and rate expressions for Systems Manager in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.   To use offsets, you must specify the ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval parameter. This option tells the system not to run an association immediately after you create it.
    ///   - syncCompliance: The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify AUTO or MANUAL. In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is COMPLIANT. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT. In MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a parameter for the PutComplianceItems API operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the PutComplianceItems API operation. By default, all associations use AUTO mode.
    ///   - tags: Adds or overwrites one or more tags for a State Manager association. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your Amazon Web Services resources. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.

    ///   - targetMaps: A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.
    ///   - targets: The targets for the association. You can target managed nodes by using tags, Amazon Web Services resource groups, all managed nodes in an Amazon Web Services account, or individual managed node IDs. You can target all managed nodes in an Amazon Web Services account by specifying the InstanceIds key with a value of *.

    /// Create or update a parameter in Parameter Store.
    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - allowedPattern: A regular expression used to validate the parameter value. For example, for String types with values restricted to numbers, you can specify the following: AllowedPattern=^\d+$
    ///   - dataType: The data type for a String parameter. Supported data types include plain text and Amazon Machine Image (AMI) IDs.  The following data type values are supported.     text     aws:ec2:image     aws:ssm:integration    When you create a String parameter and specify aws:ec2:image, Amazon Web Services Systems Manager validates the parameter value is in the required format, such as ami-12345abcdeEXAMPLE, and that the specified AMI is available in your Amazon Web Services account.  If the action is successful, the service sends back an HTTP 200 response which indicates a successful PutParameter call for all cases except for data type aws:ec2:image. If you call PutParameter with aws:ec2:image data type, a successful HTTP 200 response does not guarantee that your parameter was successfully created or updated. The aws:ec2:image value is validated asynchronously, and the PutParameter call returns before the validation is complete. If you submit an invalid AMI value, the PutParameter operation will return success, but the asynchronous validation will fail and the parameter will not be created or updated. To monitor whether your aws:ec2:image parameters are created successfully, see Setting up notifications or trigger actions based on Parameter Store events. For more information about AMI format validation , see Native parameter support for Amazon Machine Image IDs.
    ///   - description: Information about the parameter that you want to add to the system. Optional but recommended.  Don't enter personally identifiable information in this field.
    ///   - keyId: The Key Management Service (KMS) ID that you want to use to encrypt a parameter. Use a custom key for better security. Required for parameters that use the SecureString data type. If you don't specify a key ID, the system uses the default key associated with your Amazon Web Services account, which is not as secure as using a custom key.   To use a custom KMS key, choose the SecureString data type with the Key ID parameter.
    ///   - name: The fully qualified name of the parameter that you want to create or update.  You can't enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a parameter, only the parameter name itself.  The fully qualified name includes the complete hierarchy of the parameter path and name. For parameters in a hierarchy, you must include a leading forward slash character (/) when you create or reference a parameter. For example: /Dev/DBServer/MySQL/db-string13  Naming Constraints:   Parameter names are case sensitive.   A parameter name must be unique within an Amazon Web Services Region   A parameter name can't be prefixed with "aws" or "ssm" (case-insensitive).   Parameter names can include only the following symbols and letters: a-zA-Z0-9_.-  In addition, the slash character ( / ) is used to delineate hierarchies in parameter names. For example: /Dev/Production/East/Project-ABC/MyParameter    A parameter name can't include spaces.   Parameter hierarchies are limited to a maximum depth of fifteen levels.   For additional information about valid values for parameter names, see Creating Systems Manager parameters in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.  The reported maximum length of 2048 characters for a parameter name includes 1037 characters that are reserved for internal use by Systems Manager. The maximum length for a parameter name that you specify is 1011 characters. This count of 1011 characters includes the characters in the ARN that precede the name you specify. This ARN length will vary depending on your partition and Region. For example, the following 45 characters count toward the 1011 character maximum for a parameter created in the US East (Ohio) Region: arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:111122223333:parameter/.
    ///   - overwrite: Overwrite an existing parameter. The default value is false.
    ///   - policies: One or more policies to apply to a parameter. This operation takes a JSON array. Parameter Store, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager supports the following policy types: Expiration: This policy deletes the parameter after it expires. When you create the policy, you specify the expiration date. You can update the expiration date and time by updating the policy. Updating the parameter doesn't affect the expiration date and time. When the expiration time is reached, Parameter Store deletes the parameter. ExpirationNotification: This policy initiates an event in Amazon CloudWatch Events that notifies you about the expiration. By using this policy, you can receive notification before or after the expiration time is reached, in units of days or hours. NoChangeNotification: This policy initiates a CloudWatch Events event if a parameter hasn't been modified for a specified period of time. This policy type is useful when, for example, a secret needs to be changed within a period of time, but it hasn't been changed. All existing policies are preserved until you send new policies or an empty policy. For more information about parameter policies, see Assigning parameter policies.
    ///   - tags: Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or environment. For example, you might want to tag a Systems Manager parameter to identify the type of resource to which it applies, the environment, or the type of configuration data referenced by the parameter. In this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:    Key=Resource,Value=S3bucket     Key=OS,Value=Windows     Key=ParameterType,Value=LicenseKey     To add tags to an existing Systems Manager parameter, use the AddTagsToResource operation.
    ///   - tier: The parameter tier to assign to a parameter. Parameter Store offers a standard tier and an advanced tier for parameters. Standard parameters have a content size limit of 4 KB and can't be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 10,000 standard parameters for each Region in an Amazon Web Services account. Standard parameters are offered at no additional cost.  Advanced parameters have a content size limit of 8 KB and can be configured to use parameter policies. You can create a maximum of 100,000 advanced parameters for each Region in an Amazon Web Services account. Advanced parameters incur a charge. For more information, see Managing parameter tiers in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. You can change a standard parameter to an advanced parameter any time. But you can't revert an advanced parameter to a standard parameter. Reverting an advanced parameter to a standard parameter would result in data loss because the system would truncate the size of the parameter from 8 KB to 4 KB. Reverting would also remove any policies attached to the parameter. Lastly, advanced parameters use a different form of encryption than standard parameters.  If you no longer need an advanced parameter, or if you no longer want to incur charges for an advanced parameter, you must delete it and recreate it as a new standard parameter.   Using the Default Tier Configuration  In PutParameter requests, you can specify the tier to create the parameter in. Whenever you specify a tier in the request, Parameter Store creates or updates the parameter according to that request. However, if you don't specify a tier in a request, Parameter Store assigns the tier based on the current Parameter Store default tier configuration. The default tier when you begin using Parameter Store is the standard-parameter tier. If you use the advanced-parameter tier, you can specify one of the following as the default:    Advanced: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates all requests as advanced parameters.     Intelligent-Tiering: With this option, Parameter Store evaluates each request to determine if the parameter is standard or advanced.  If the request doesn't include any options that require an advanced parameter, the parameter is created in the standard-parameter tier. If one or more options requiring an advanced parameter are included in the request, Parameter Store create a parameter in the advanced-parameter tier. This approach helps control your parameter-related costs by always creating standard parameters unless an advanced parameter is necessary.    Options that require an advanced parameter include the following:   The content size of the parameter is more than 4 KB.   The parameter uses a parameter policy.   More than 10,000 parameters already exist in your Amazon Web Services account in the current Amazon Web Services Region.   For more information about configuring the default tier option, see Specifying a default parameter tier in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.
    ///   - type: The type of parameter that you want to create.   SecureString isn't currently supported for CloudFormation templates.  Items in a StringList must be separated by a comma (,). You can't use other punctuation or special character to escape items in the list. If you have a parameter value that requires a comma, then use the String data type.  Specifying a parameter type isn't required when updating a parameter. You must specify a parameter type when creating a parameter.
    ///   - value: The parameter value that you want to add to the system. Standard parameters have a value limit of 4 KB. Advanced parameters have a value limit of 8 KB.  Parameters can't be referenced or nested in the values of other parameters. You can't include values wrapped in double brackets {{}} or {{ssm:parameter-name}} in a parameter value.

Specify true for ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval if you want the association to run only according to the schedule you specified. If you chose this option when you created an association and later you edit that association or you make changes to the Automation runbook or SSM document on which that association is based, State Manager applies the association at the next specified cron interval. For example, if you chose the Latest version of an SSM document when you created an association and you edit the association by choosing a different document version on the Documents page, State Manager applies the association at the next specified cron interval if you previously set ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval to true. If this option wasn't selected, State Manager immediately runs the association. For more information, see Understanding when associations are applied to resources and About target updates with Automation runbooks in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions. You can reset this parameter. To do so, specify the no-apply-only-at-cron-interval parameter when you update the association from the command line. This parameter forces the association to run immediately after updating it and according to the interval specified.
    ///   - associationId: The ID of the association you want to update.
    ///   - associationName: The name of the association that you want to update.
    ///   - associationVersion: This parameter is provided for concurrency control purposes. You must specify the latest association version in the service. If you want to ensure that this request succeeds, either specify $LATEST, or omit this parameter.
    ///   - automationTargetParameterName: Choose the parameter that will define how your automation will branch out. This target is required for associations that use an Automation runbook and target resources by using rate controls. Automation is a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.
    ///   - calendarNames: The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar type documents you want to gate your associations under. The associations only run when that change calendar is open. For more information, see Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Calendar in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.
    ///   - complianceSeverity: The severity level to assign to the association.
    ///   - documentVersion: The document version you want update for the association.   State Manager doesn't support running associations that use a new version of a document if that document is shared from another account. State Manager always runs the default version of a document if shared from another account, even though the Systems Manager console shows that a new version was processed. If you want to run an association using a new version of a document shared form another account, you must set the document version to default.
    ///   - duration: The number of hours the association can run before it is canceled. Duration applies to associations that are currently running, and any pending and in progress commands on all targets. If a target was taken offline for the association to run, it is made available again immediately, without a reboot.  The Duration parameter applies only when both these conditions are true:   The association for which you specify a duration is cancelable according to the parameters of the SSM command document or Automation runbook associated with this execution.    The command specifies the  ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval parameter, which means that the association doesn't run immediately after it is updated, but only according to the specified schedule.
    ///   - maxConcurrency: The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at the same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same time. If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an association while Systems Manager is running MaxConcurrency associations, the association is allowed to run. During the next association interval, the new managed node will process its association within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency.
    ///   - maxErrors: The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops sending requests to run the association on additional targets. You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 managed nodes and set MaxError to 10%, then the system stops sending the request when the sixth error is received. Executions that are already running an association when MaxErrors is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.
    ///   - name: The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that contains the configuration information for the managed node. You can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents you created, or a document that is shared with you from another account. For Systems Manager document (SSM document) that are shared with you from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you must specify the complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:  arn:aws:ssm:region:account-id:document/document-name   For example:  arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document  For Amazon Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you created in your account, you only need to specify the document name. For example, AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline or My-Document.
    ///   - outputLocation: An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this request.
    ///   - parameters: The parameters you want to update for the association. If you create a parameter using Parameter Store, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, you can reference the parameter using {{ssm:parameter-name}}.
    ///   - scheduleExpression: The cron expression used to schedule the association that you want to update.
    ///   - scheduleOffset: Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an association. For example, if you specified a cron schedule of cron(0 0 ? * THU#2 *), you could specify an offset of 3 to run the association each Sunday after the second Thursday of the month. For more information about cron schedules for associations, see Reference: Cron and rate expressions for Systems Manager in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.   To use offsets, you must specify the ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval parameter. This option tells the system not to run an association immediately after you create it.
    ///   - syncCompliance: The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify AUTO or MANUAL. In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the association execution to determine the compliance status. If the association execution runs successfully, then the association is COMPLIANT. If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT. In MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a parameter for the PutComplianceItems API operation. In this case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a tool in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is managed by your direct call to the PutComplianceItems API operation. By default, all associations use AUTO mode.
    ///   - targetLocations: A location is a combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web Services accounts where you want to run the association. Use this action to update an association in multiple Regions and multiple accounts.
