This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task-level cpu value.  You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the Amazon EC2 Instances detail page by 1,024.  Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that is the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see CPU share constraint in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter is not required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:    Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0: Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares.    Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0: Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.   On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU that is described in the task definition. A null or zero CPU value is passed to Docker as 0, which Windows interprets as 1% of one CPU.

However, we recommend using the latest container agent version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the latest version, see Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If you are using an Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI, your instance needs at least version 1.26.0-1 of the ecs-init package. If your container instances are launched from version 20190301 or later, then they contain the required versions of the container agent and ecs-init.

        /// The log configuration specification for the container. This parameter maps to LogConfig in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --log-driver option to docker run. By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container may use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker documentation.  Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the LogConfiguration data type). Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent.  This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log in to your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version --format '{{.Server.APIVersion}}'   The Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
        public let logConfiguration: LogConfiguration?
        /// The amount (in MiB) of memory to present to the container. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified here, the container is killed. The total amount of memory reserved for all containers within a task must be lower than the task memory value, if one is specified. This parameter maps to Memory in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory option to docker run. If using the Fargate launch type, this parameter is optional. If using the EC2 launch type, you must specify either a task-level memory value or a container-level memory value. If you specify both a container-level memory and memoryReservation value, memory must be greater than memoryReservation. If you specify memoryReservation, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance on which the container is placed. Otherwise, the value of memory is used. The Docker daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a container, so you should not specify fewer than 4 MiB of memory for your containers.
        public let memory: Int?
        /// The soft limit (in MiB) of memory to reserve for the container. When system memory is under heavy contention, Docker attempts to keep the container memory to this soft limit. However, your container can consume more memory when it needs to, up to either the hard limit specified with the memory parameter (if applicable), or all of the available memory on the container instance, whichever comes first. This parameter maps to MemoryReservation in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory-reservation option to docker run. If a task-level memory value is not specified, you must specify a non-zero integer for one or both of memory or memoryReservation in a container definition. If you specify both, memory must be greater than memoryReservation. If you specify memoryReservation, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance on which the container is placed. Otherwise, the value of memory is used. For example, if your container normally uses 128 MiB of memory, but occasionally bursts to 256 MiB of memory for short periods of time, you can set a memoryReservation of 128 MiB, and a memory hard limit of 300 MiB. This configuration would allow the container to only reserve 128 MiB of memory from the remaining resources on the container instance, but also allow the container to consume more memory resources when needed. The Docker daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a container, so you should not specify fewer than 4 MiB of memory for your containers.

For task definitions that use the awsvpc network mode, you should only specify the containerPort. The hostPort can be left blank or it must be the same value as the containerPort. Port mappings on Windows use the NetNAT gateway address rather than localhost. There is no loopback for port mappings on Windows, so you cannot access a container's mapped port from the host itself.  This parameter maps to PortBindings in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --publish option to docker run. If the network mode of a task definition is set to none, then you can't specify port mappings. If the network mode of a task definition is set to host, then host ports must either be undefined or they must match the container port in the port mapping.  After a task reaches the RUNNING status, manual and automatic host and container port assignments are visible in the Network Bindings section of a container description for a selected task in the Amazon ECS console. The assignments are also visible in the networkBindings section DescribeTasks responses.

For example, you specify two containers in a task definition with containerA having a dependency on containerB reaching a COMPLETE, SUCCESS, or HEALTHY status. If a startTimeout value is specified for containerB and it does not reach the desired status within that time then containerA will give up and not start. This results in the task transitioning to a STOPPED state.  When the ECS_CONTAINER_START_TIMEOUT container agent configuration variable is used, it is enforced indendently from this start timeout value.  For tasks using the Fargate launch type, this parameter requires that the task or service uses platform version 1.3.0 or later. For tasks using the EC2 launch type, your container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to enable a container start timeout value. However, we recommend using the latest container agent version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the latest version, see Updating the Amazon ECS Container Agent in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If you are using an Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI, your instance needs at least version 1.26.0-1 of the ecs-init package. If your container instances are launched from version 20190301 or later, then they contain the required versions of the container agent and ecs-init. For more information, see Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

For tasks using the Fargate launch type, the task or service requires platform version 1.3.0 or later. The max stop timeout value is 120 seconds and if the parameter is not specified, the default value of 30 seconds is used. For tasks using the EC2 launch type, if the stopTimeout parameter is not specified, the value set for the Amazon ECS container agent configuration variable ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT is used by default. If neither the stopTimeout parameter or the ECS_CONTAINER_STOP_TIMEOUT agent configuration variable are set, then the default values of 30 seconds for Linux containers and 30 seconds on Windows containers are used. Your container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to enable a container stop timeout value. However, we recommend using the latest container agent version.

For more information, see Fargate capacity providers in the Amazon ECS User Guide for Fargate.  The EC2 launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances registered to your cluster. The EXTERNAL launch type runs your tasks on your on-premise server or virtual machine (VM) capacity registered to your cluster. A service can use either a launch type or a capacity provider strategy.

The service-linked role is required for services that make use of multiple target groups. For more information, see Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. If the service is using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, the service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When creating an CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups (referred to as a targetGroupPair). During a deployment, CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status PRIMARY and associates one target group with it, and then associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener that allows you perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it. After you create a service using the ECS deployment controller, the load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and container port specified in the service definition are immutable. If you are using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, these values can be changed when updating the service. For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. The load balancer name parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group specified here. For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. The target group ARN parameter must be omitted. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the load balancer specified here. Services with tasks that use the awsvpc network mode (for example, those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers are not supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance, because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.

If you specify the role parameter, you must also specify a load balancer object with the loadBalancers parameter.  If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used by default for your service unless you specify a role here. The service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the awsvpc network mode or if the service is configured to use service discovery, an external deployment controller, multiple target groups, or Elastic Inference accelerators in which case you should not specify a role here. For more information, see Using service-linked roles for Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.  If your specified role has a path other than /, then you must either specify the full role ARN (this is recommended) or prefix the role name with the path.

This scheduler strategy is required if the service is using the CODE_DEPLOY or EXTERNAL deployment controller types.    DAEMON-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When you're using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.

For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Windows instances, &lt;default&gt; or awsvpc can be used. If the network mode is set to none, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The host and awsvpc network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge mode. With the host and awsvpc network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the host network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the awsvpc network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings.   When using the host network mode, you should not run containers using the root user (UID 0). It is considered best practice to use a non-root user.  If the network mode is awsvpc, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration value when you create a service or run a task with the task definition.

For Amazon ECS tasks on Amazon EC2 Windows instances, &lt;default&gt; or awsvpc can be used. If the network mode is set to none, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The host and awsvpc network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge mode. With the host and awsvpc network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the host network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the awsvpc network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings.   When using the host network mode, you should not run containers using the root user (UID 0). It is considered best practice to use a non-root user.  If the network mode is awsvpc, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration value when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.
