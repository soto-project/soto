/// Amazon Polly is a web service that makes it easy to synthesize speech from text. The Amazon Polly service provides API operations for synthesizing high-quality speech from plain text and Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), along with managing pronunciations lexicons that enable you to get the best results for your application domain.

Using the DescribeVoices operation you can provide the user with a list of available voices to select from.  You can optionally specify a language code to filter the available voices. For example, if you specify en-US, the operation returns a list of all available US English voices.  This operation requires permissions to perform the polly:DescribeVoices action.
