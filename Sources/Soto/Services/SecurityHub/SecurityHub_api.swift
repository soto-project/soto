/// Service object for interacting with AWS SecurityHub service.
///
/// Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of your Amazon Web Services environment and resources. It also provides you with the readiness status of your environment based on controls from supported security standards. Security Hub collects security data from Amazon Web Services accounts, services, and integrated third-party products and helps you analyze security trends in your environment to identify the highest priority security issues. For more information about Security Hub, see the Security HubUser Guide. When you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only in the Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or settings change that results from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, run the same command for each Region in which you want to apply the change. For example, if your Region is set to us-west-2, when you use CreateMembers to add a member account to Security Hub, the association of the member account with the administrator account is created only in the us-west-2 Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in the same Region that the invitation was sent from. The following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API operations.    BatchEnableStandards - RateLimit of 1 request per second. BurstLimit of 1 request per second.    GetFindings - RateLimit of 3 requests per second. BurstLimit of 6 requests per second.    BatchImportFindings - RateLimit of 10 requests per second. BurstLimit of 30 requests per second.    BatchUpdateFindings - RateLimit of 10 requests per second. BurstLimit of 30 requests per second.    UpdateStandardsControl - RateLimit of 1 request per second. BurstLimit of 5 requests per second.   All other operations - RateLimit of 10 requests per second. BurstLimit of 30 requests per second.

The account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub.   This action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub enabled.

If the account owner accepts the invitation, the account becomes a member account in Security Hub. Accounts that are managed using Organizations do not receive an invitation. They automatically become a member account in Security Hub.   If the organization account does not have Security Hub enabled, then Security Hub and the default standards are automatically enabled. Note that Security Hub cannot be enabled automatically for the organization management account. The organization management account must enable Security Hub before the administrator account enables it as a member account.   For organization accounts that already have Security Hub enabled, Security Hub does not make any other changes to those accounts. It does not change their enabled standards or controls.
