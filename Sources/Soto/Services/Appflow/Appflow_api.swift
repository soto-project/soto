/// Service object for interacting with AWS Appflow service.
///
/// Welcome to the Amazon AppFlow API reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Amazon AppFlow API operations, data types, and errors.  Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you to securely transfer data between software as a service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and Amazon Web Services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift.  Use the following links to get started on the Amazon AppFlow API:    Actions: An alphabetical list of all Amazon AppFlow API operations.    Data types: An alphabetical list of all Amazon AppFlow data types.    Common parameters: Parameters that all Query operations can use.    Common errors: Client and server errors that all operations can return.   If you're new to Amazon AppFlow, we recommend that you review the Amazon AppFlow User Guide. Amazon AppFlow API users can use vendor-specific mechanisms for OAuth, and include applicable OAuth attributes (such as auth-code and redirecturi) with the connector-specific ConnectorProfileProperties when creating a new connector profile using Amazon AppFlow API operations. For example, Salesforce users can refer to the  Authorize Apps with OAuth documentation.

    /// Cancels active runs for a flow. You can cancel all of the active runs for a flow, or you can cancel specific runs by providing their IDs. You can cancel a flow run only when the run is in progress. You can't cancel a run that has already completed or failed. You also can't cancel a run that's scheduled to occur but hasn't started yet. To prevent a scheduled run, you can deactivate the flow with the StopFlow action. You cannot resume a run after you cancel it. When you send your request, the status for each run becomes CancelStarted. When the cancellation completes, the status becomes Canceled.  When you cancel a run, you still incur charges for any data that the run already processed before the cancellation. If the run had already written some data to the flow destination, then that data remains in the destination. If you configured the flow to use a batch API (such as the Salesforce Bulk API 2.0), then the run will finish reading or writing its entire batch of data after the cancellation. For these operations, the data processing charges for Amazon AppFlow apply. For the pricing information, see Amazon AppFlow pricing.
