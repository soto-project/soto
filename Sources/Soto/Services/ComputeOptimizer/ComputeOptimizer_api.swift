/// Service object for interacting with AWS ComputeOptimizer service.
///
/// Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and utilization metrics of your Amazon Web Services compute resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Lambda functions, Amazon EBS volumes, and Amazon ECS services on Fargate.  It reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads. Compute Optimizer also provides recent utilization metric data, in addition to projected utilization metric data for the recommendations, which you can use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best price-performance trade-off. The analysis of your usage patterns can help you decide when to move or resize your running resources, and still meet your performance and capacity requirements. For more information about Compute Optimizer, including the required permissions to use the service, see the Compute Optimizer User Guide.

    ///   - externalMetricsPreference: The provider of the external metrics recommendation preference to create or update. Specify a valid provider in the source field to activate the preference. To delete this preference, see the DeleteRecommendationPreferences action. This preference can only be set for the Ec2Instance resource type. For more information, see External metrics ingestion in the Compute Optimizer User Guide.

To deactivate it, create a recommendation preference.  Specify the Inactive status to deactivate the feature, or specify Active to activate it. For more information, see Inferred workload types in the Compute Optimizer User Guide.
    ///   - lookBackPeriod:  The preference to control the number of days the utilization metrics of the Amazon Web Services resource are analyzed.  When this preference isn't specified, we use the default value DAYS_14.  You can only set this preference for the Amazon EC2 instance and Auto Scaling group resource types.     Amazon EC2 instance lookback preferences can be set at the organization, account, and resource levels.   Auto Scaling group lookback preferences can only be set at the resource level.
    ///   - preferredResources:  The preference to control which resource type values are considered when generating rightsizing recommendations.  You can specify this preference as a combination of include and exclude lists. You must specify either an  includeList or excludeList. If the preference is an empty set of resource type values,  an error occurs.   You can only set this preference for the Amazon EC2 instance and Auto Scaling group resource types.

Specify the AfterDiscounts status to activate the preference, or specify BeforeDiscounts to deactivate the preference. Only the account manager or delegated administrator of your organization can activate this preference. For more information, see  Savings estimation mode in the Compute Optimizer User Guide.

You can create recommendation preferences at the organization level (for management accounts of an organization only), account level, and resource level. For more information, see Activating enhanced infrastructure metrics in the Compute Optimizer User Guide.  You cannot create recommendation preferences for Auto Scaling groups at the organization and account levels. You can create recommendation preferences for Auto Scaling groups only at the resource level by specifying a scope name of ResourceArn and a scope value of the Auto Scaling group Amazon Resource Name (ARN). This will configure the preference for all instances that are part of the specified Auto Scaling group. You also cannot create recommendation preferences at the resource level for instances that are part of an Auto Scaling group. You can create recommendation preferences at the resource level only for standalone instances.
