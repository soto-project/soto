    /// Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access Amazon Web Services resources. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use AssumeRole within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of AssumeRole with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials and Compare STS credentials in the IAM User Guide.  Permissions  The temporary security credentials created by AssumeRole can be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: You cannot call the Amazon Web Services STS GetFederationToken or GetSessionToken API operations. (Optional) You can pass inline or managed session policies to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new  temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the  role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary  credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns  the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed  by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide. When you create a role, you create two policies: a role trust policy that specifies who can assume the role, and a permissions policy that specifies what can be done with the role. You specify the trusted principal that is allowed to assume the role in the role trust policy. To assume a role from a different account, your Amazon Web Services account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account.  A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call AssumeRole for the ARN of the role in the other account. To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of the following:   Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call AssumeRole (as long as the role's trust policy trusts the account).   Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.   You can do either because the roleâ€™s trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same account, no additional identity-based policy is required. For more information about trust policies and resource-based policies, see IAM Policies in the IAM User Guide.  Tags  (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see Passing Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide. An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control in the IAM User Guide. You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see Chaining Roles with Session Tags in the IAM User Guide.  Using MFA with AssumeRole  (Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when you call AssumeRole. This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an Amazon Web Services MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.  "Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}  For more information, see Configuring MFA-Protected API Access in the IAM User Guide guide. To use MFA with AssumeRole, you pass values for the SerialNumber and TokenCode parameters. The SerialNumber value identifies the user's hardware or virtual MFA device. The TokenCode is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the MFA device produces.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - durationSeconds: The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value specified can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration set for the role. The maximum session duration setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value higher than this setting or the administrator setting (whichever is lower), the operation fails. For example, if you specify a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maximum session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails.  Role chaining limits your Amazon Web Services CLI or Amazon Web Services API role session to a maximum of one hour. When you use the AssumeRole API operation to assume a role, you can specify the duration of your role session with the DurationSeconds parameter. You can specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12 hours), depending on the maximum session duration setting for your role. However, if you assume a role using role chaining and provide a DurationSeconds parameter value greater than one hour, the operation fails. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see Update the maximum session duration for a role. By default, the value is set to 3600 seconds.   The DurationSeconds parameter is separate from the duration of a console session that you might request using the returned credentials. The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a SessionDuration parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session. For more information, see Creating a URL that Enables Federated Users to Access the Amazon Web Services Management Console in the IAM User Guide.
    ///   - externalId: A unique identifier that might be required when you assume a role in another account. If the administrator of the account to which the role belongs provided you with an external ID, then provide that value in the ExternalId parameter. This value can be any string, such as a passphrase or account number. A cross-account role is usually set up to trust everyone in an account. Therefore, the administrator of the trusting account might send an external ID to the administrator of the trusted account. That way, only someone with the ID can assume the role, rather than everyone in the account. For more information about the external ID, see How to Use an External ID When Granting Access to Your Amazon Web Services Resources to a Third Party in the IAM User Guide. The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of  characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces.  You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-
    ///   - policy: An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy. This parameter is optional. Passing policies to this operation returns new  temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the  role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary  credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns  the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed  by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\u0020 through \u00FF). It can also include the tab (\u0009), linefeed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D) characters.  An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed inline session policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The PackedPolicySize response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.  For more information about role session permissions, see Session policies.
    ///   - policyArns: The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the same account as the role. This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed policy ARNs. However, the plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.  An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed inline session policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements.

Passing policies to this operation returns new  temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the  role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary  credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns  the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed  by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide.
    ///   - providedContexts: A list of previously acquired trusted context assertions in the format of a JSON array. The trusted context assertion is signed and encrypted by Amazon Web Services STS. The following is an example of a ProvidedContext value that includes a single trusted context assertion and the ARN of the context provider from which the trusted context assertion was generated.  [{"ProviderArn":"arn:aws:iam::aws:contextProvider/IdentityCenter","ContextAssertion":"trusted-context-assertion"}]
    ///   - roleArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role to assume.
    ///   - roleSessionName: An identifier for the assumed role session. Use the role session name to uniquely identify a session when the same role is assumed by different principals or for different reasons. In cross-account scenarios, the role session name is visible to, and can be logged by the account that owns the role. The role session name is also used in the ARN of the assumed role principal. This means that subsequent cross-account API requests that use the temporary security credentials will expose the role session name to the external account in their CloudTrail logs. For security purposes, administrators can view this field in CloudTrail logs to help identify who performed an action in Amazon Web Services. Your administrator might require that you specify your user name as the session name when you assume the role. For more information, see  sts:RoleSessionName . The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters  consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can  also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@-
    ///   - serialNumber: The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the user who is making the AssumeRole call. Specify this value if the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as GAHT12345678) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user). The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters  consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can  also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@-
    ///   - sourceIdentity: The source identity specified by the principal that is calling the AssumeRole operation. The source identity value persists across chained role sessions. You can require users to specify a source identity when they assume a role. You do this by using the  sts:SourceIdentity condition key in a role trust policy. You can use source identity information in CloudTrail logs to determine who took actions with a role. You can use the aws:SourceIdentity condition key to further control access to Amazon Web Services resources based on the value of source identity. For more information about using source identity, see Monitor and control actions taken with assumed roles in the IAM User Guide. The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces. You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: +=,.@-. You cannot use a value that begins with the text aws:. This prefix is reserved for Amazon Web Services internal use.
    ///   - tags: A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see Tagging Amazon Web Services STS Sessions in the IAM User Guide. This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys canâ€™t exceed 128 characters, and the values canâ€™t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see IAM and STS Character Limits in the IAM User Guide.  An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed inline session policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The PackedPolicySize response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.  You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already attached to the role. When you do, session tags override a role tag with the same key.  Tag keyâ€“value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate Department and department tag keys. Assume that the role has the Department=Marketing tag and you pass the department=engineering session tag. Department and department are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the role tag. Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this operation, the new session inherits any transitive session tags from the calling session. If you pass a session tag with the same key as an inherited tag, the operation fails. To view the inherited tags for a session, see the CloudTrail logs. For more information, see Viewing Session Tags in CloudTrail in the IAM User Guide.
    ///   - tokenCode: The value provided by the MFA device, if the trust policy of the role being assumed requires MFA. (In other words, if the policy includes a condition that tests for MFA). If the role being assumed requires MFA and if the TokenCode value is missing or expired, the AssumeRole call returns an "access denied" error. The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a sequence of six numeric digits.
    ///   - transitiveTagKeys: A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive. If you set a tag key as transitive, the corresponding key and value passes to subsequent sessions in a role chain. For more information, see Chaining Roles with Session Tags in the IAM User Guide. This parameter is optional. The transitive status of a session tag does not impact its packed binary size. If you choose not to specify a transitive tag key, then no tags are passed from this session to any subsequent sessions.

To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role in the IAM User Guide. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the AssumeRole* API operations or the assume-role* CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see Using IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide.   Role chaining limits your CLI or Amazon Web Services API role session to a maximum of one hour. When you use the AssumeRole API operation to assume a role, you can specify the duration of your role session with the DurationSeconds parameter. You can specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12 hours), depending on the maximum session duration setting for your role. However, if you assume a role using role chaining and provide a DurationSeconds parameter value greater than one hour, the operation fails.   Permissions  The temporary security credentials created by AssumeRoleWithSAML can be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS GetFederationToken or GetSessionToken API operations. (Optional) You can pass inline or managed session policies to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new  temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the  role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary  credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns  the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed  by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide. Calling AssumeRoleWithSAML does not require the use of Amazon Web Services security credentials. The identity of the caller is validated by using keys in the metadata document that is uploaded for the SAML provider entity for your identity provider.   Calling AssumeRoleWithSAML can result in an entry in your CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the value in the NameID element of the SAML assertion. We recommend that you use a NameIDType that is not associated with any personally identifiable information (PII). For example, you could instead use the persistent identifier (urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent).   Tags  (Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your SAML assertion as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see Passing Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys canâ€™t exceed 128 characters and the values canâ€™t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see IAM and STS Character Limits in the IAM User Guide.  An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed inline session policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The PackedPolicySize response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.  You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached to the role. When you do, session tags override the role's tags with the same key. An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control in the IAM User Guide. You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see Chaining Roles with Session Tags in the IAM User Guide.  SAML Configuration  Before your application can call AssumeRoleWithSAML, you must configure your SAML identity provider (IdP) to issue the claims required by Amazon Web Services. Additionally, you must use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create a SAML provider entity in your Amazon Web Services account that represents your identity provider. You must also create an IAM role that specifies this SAML provider in its trust policy.  For more information, see the following resources:    About SAML 2.0-based Federation in the IAM User Guide.     Creating SAML Identity Providers in the IAM User Guide.

Example providers include the OAuth 2.0 providers Login with Amazon and Facebook, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider such as Google or Amazon Cognito federated identities.  For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the Amazon Web Services SDK for iOS Developer Guide and the Amazon Web Services SDK for Android Developer Guide to uniquely identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application. To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see Amazon Cognito identity pools in Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.  Calling AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity does not require the use of Amazon Web Services security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term Amazon Web Services credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term Amazon Web Services credentials.

Identities  Before your application can call AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity, you must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role's trust policy.   Calling AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity can result in an entry in your CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the Subject of the provided web identity token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field.

A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network. You must call the GetFederationToken operation using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user. As a result, this call is appropriate in contexts where those credentials can be safeguarded, usually in a server-based application. For a comparison of GetFederationToken with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials and Compare STS credentials in the IAM User Guide. Although it is possible to call GetFederationToken using the security credentials of an Amazon Web Services account root user rather than an IAM user that you create for the purpose of a proxy application, we do not recommend it. For more information, see Safeguard your root user credentials and don't use them for everyday tasks in the IAM User Guide.   You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito or AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity. For more information, see Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider in the IAM User Guide.   Session duration  The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials obtained by using the root user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).  Permissions  You can use the temporary credentials created by GetFederationToken in any Amazon Web Services service with the following exceptions:   You cannot call any IAM operations using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services API. This limitation does not apply to console sessions.   You cannot call any STS operations except GetCallerIdentity.   You can use temporary credentials for single sign-on (SSO) to the console. You must pass an inline or managed session policy to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide. For information about using GetFederationToken to create temporary security credentials, see GetFederationTokenâ€”Federation Through a Custom Identity Broker.  You can use the credentials to access a resource that has a resource-based policy. If that policy specifically references the federated user session in the Principal element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.  Tags  (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see Passing Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide.  You can create a mobile-based or browser-based app that can authenticate users using a web identity provider like Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider. In this case, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito or AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity. For more information, see Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider in the IAM User Guide.  An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control in the IAM User Guide. Tag keyâ€“value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate Department and department tag keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the Department=Marketing tag and you pass the department=engineering session tag. Department and department are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the user tag.

    /// Returns a set of temporary credentials for an Amazon Web Services account or IAM user. The credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use GetSessionToken if you want to use MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific Amazon Web Services API operations like Amazon EC2 StopInstances. MFA-enabled IAM users must call GetSessionToken and submit an MFA code that is associated with their MFA device. Using the temporary security credentials that the call returns, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to API operations that require MFA authentication. An incorrect MFA code causes the API to return an access denied error. For a comparison of GetSessionToken with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see Requesting Temporary Security Credentials and Compare STS credentials in the IAM User Guide.  No permissions are required for users to perform this operation. The purpose of the sts:GetSessionToken operation is to authenticate the user using MFA. You cannot use policies to control authentication operations. For more information, see Permissions for GetSessionToken in the IAM User Guide.   Session Duration  The GetSessionToken operation must be called by using the long-term Amazon Web Services security credentials of an IAM user. Credentials that are created by IAM users are valid for the duration that you specify. This duration can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with a default of 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Credentials based on account credentials can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to 3,600 seconds (1 hour), with a default of 1 hour.   Permissions  The temporary security credentials created by GetSessionToken can be used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exceptions:   You cannot call any IAM API operations unless MFA authentication information is included in the request.   You cannot call any STS API except AssumeRole or GetCallerIdentity.   The credentials that GetSessionToken returns are based on permissions associated with the IAM user whose credentials were used to call the operation. The temporary credentials have the same permissions as the IAM user.  Although it is possible to call GetSessionToken using the security credentials of an Amazon Web Services account root user rather than an IAM user, we do not recommend it. If GetSessionToken is called using root user credentials, the temporary credentials have root user permissions. For more information, see Safeguard your root user credentials and don't use them for everyday tasks in the IAM User Guide   For more information about using GetSessionToken to create temporary credentials, see Temporary Credentials for Users in Untrusted Environments in the IAM User Guide.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - durationSeconds: The duration, in seconds, that the credentials should remain valid. Acceptable durations for IAM user sessions range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with 43,200 seconds (12 hours) as the default. Sessions for Amazon Web Services account owners are restricted to a maximum of 3,600 seconds (one hour). If the duration is longer than one hour, the session for Amazon Web Services account owners defaults to one hour.
    ///   - serialNumber: The identification number of the MFA device that is associated with the IAM user who is making the GetSessionToken call. Specify this value if the IAM user has a policy that requires MFA authentication. The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as GAHT12345678) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device (such as arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user). You can find the device for an IAM user by going to the Amazon Web Services Management Console and viewing the user's security credentials.  The regex used to validate this parameter is a string of  characters consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with no spaces.  You can also include underscores or any of the following characters: =,.@:/-
    ///   - tokenCode: The value provided by the MFA device, if MFA is required. If any policy requires the IAM user to submit an MFA code, specify this value. If MFA authentication is required, the user must provide a code when requesting a set of temporary security credentials. A user who fails to provide the code receives an "access denied" response when requesting resources that require MFA authentication. The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a sequence of six numeric digits.
