/// You can use Amazon CloudWatch Evidently to safely validate new features by serving  them to a specified percentage of your users while you roll out the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide when to ramp up traffic to your users. This helps you  reduce risk and identify unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature. You can also conduct A/B experiments to make feature design decisions based on evidence and data. An experiment can test as many as five variations at once. Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it using statistical methods. It also provides clear recommendations about which variations perform better. You can test both user-facing features and backend features.

    /// This operation assigns feature variation to user sessions. For each user session, you pass in an entityID that represents the user. Evidently then checks the evaluation rules and assigns the variation. The first rules that are evaluated are the override rules. If the user's entityID matches an override rule, the user is served the variation specified by that rule. Next, if there is a launch of the feature, the user might be assigned to a variation in the launch. The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that are allocated to that launch. If the user is enrolled in the launch, the variation they are served depends on the allocation of the various feature variations used for the launch. If the user is not assigned to a launch, and there is an ongoing experiment for this feature,  the user might  be assigned to a variation in the experiment. The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that are allocated to that experiment. If the user is enrolled in the experiment,  the variation they are served depends on the allocation of the various feature variations used for the experiment.  If the user is not assigned to a launch or experiment, they are served the default variation.

A general practice is to reject the null hypothesis and declare that the results are statistically significant when the p-value is less than 0.05.    ConfidenceInterval specifies a confidence interval for the results.

BaseStat returns the statistical values collected for the metric for each variation. The statistic uses the same statistic specified in the baseStat parameter.
