/// Service object for interacting with AWS Keyspaces service.
///
/// Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available, and managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service. Amazon Keyspaces makes it easy to migrate, run, and scale Cassandra workloads in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With just a few clicks on the Amazon Web Services Management Console or a few lines of code,  you can create keyspaces and tables in Amazon Keyspaces, without deploying any infrastructure or installing software.  In addition to supporting Cassandra Query Language (CQL) requests via open-source Cassandra drivers,  Amazon Keyspaces supports data definition language (DDL) operations to manage keyspaces and tables using the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, as well as infrastructure as code (IaC) services and tools such as CloudFormation and Terraform. This API reference describes the supported DDL operations in detail. For the list of all supported CQL APIs, see Supported Cassandra APIs, operations, and data types  in Amazon Keyspaces in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide. To learn how Amazon Keyspaces API actions are recorded with CloudTrail, see Amazon Keyspaces information in CloudTrail in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide. For more information about Amazon Web Services APIs, for example how to implement retry logic or how to sign Amazon Web Services API requests, see Amazon Web Services APIs in the General Reference.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - autoScalingSpecification: The optional auto scaling settings for a table in provisioned capacity mode. Specifies if the service can manage throughput capacity  automatically on your behalf. Auto scaling helps you provision throughput capacity for variable workloads efficiently by increasing and decreasing  your table's read and write capacity automatically in response to application traffic. For more information, see Managing throughput capacity automatically with Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide. By default, auto scaling is disabled for a table.
    ///   - capacitySpecification: Specifies the read/write throughput capacity mode for the table. The options are:    throughputMode:PAY_PER_REQUEST and     throughputMode:PROVISIONED - Provisioned capacity mode requires readCapacityUnits and writeCapacityUnits as input.   The default is throughput_mode:PAY_PER_REQUEST. For more information, see Read/write capacity modes in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
    ///   - clientSideTimestamps:  Enables client-side timestamps for the table. By default, the setting is disabled. You can enable  client-side timestamps with the following option:    status: "enabled"    Once client-side timestamps are enabled for a table, this setting cannot be disabled.
    ///   - comment: This parameter allows to enter a description of the table.
    ///   - defaultTimeToLive: The default Time to Live setting in seconds for the table. For more information, see Setting the default TTL value for a table in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
    ///   - encryptionSpecification: Specifies how the encryption key for encryption at rest is managed for the table.   You can choose one of the following KMS key (KMS key):    type:AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY - This key is owned by Amazon Keyspaces.     type:CUSTOMER_MANAGED_KMS_KEY - This key is stored in your account and is created, owned, and managed by you.  This option  requires the kms_key_identifier of the KMS key in Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format as input.   The default is type:AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY. For more information, see Encryption at rest in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
    ///   - keyspaceName: The name of the keyspace that the table is going to be created in.
    ///   - pointInTimeRecovery: Specifies if pointInTimeRecovery is enabled or disabled for the table. The options are:    status=ENABLED     status=DISABLED    If it's not specified, the  default is status=DISABLED. For more information, see Point-in-time recovery in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
    ///   - replicaSpecifications: The optional Amazon Web Services Region specific settings of a multi-Region table. These settings overwrite the general settings of the table for the specified Region.  For a multi-Region table in provisioned capacity mode, you can configure the table's read capacity differently for each Region's replica. The write capacity, however,  remains synchronized between all replicas to ensure that there's enough capacity to replicate writes across all Regions. To define the read capacity for a table  replica in a specific Region, you can do so by configuring the following parameters.    region: The Region where these settings are applied. (Required)    readCapacityUnits: The provisioned read capacity units. (Optional)    readCapacityAutoScaling: The read capacity auto scaling settings for the table. (Optional)
    ///   - schemaDefinition: The schemaDefinition consists of the following parameters. For each column to be created:    name  -  The name of the column.    type  -  An Amazon Keyspaces data type. For more information, see Data types in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.   The primary key of the table consists of the following columns:    partitionKeys - The partition key can be a single column, or it can be a compound value composed of two or more columns. The partition key portion of the primary key is required and determines how Amazon Keyspaces stores your data.    name - The name of each partition key column.    clusteringKeys - The optional clustering column portion of your primary key determines how the data is clustered and sorted within each partition.    name - The name of the clustering column.     orderBy - Sets the ascendant (ASC) or descendant (DESC) order modifier. To define a column as static use staticColumns  -  Static columns store values that are shared by all rows in the same partition:    name  -  The name of the column.    type  -  An Amazon Keyspaces data type.
    ///   - tableName: The name of the table.
    ///   - tags: A list of key-value pair tags to be attached to the resource.  For more information, see Adding tags and labels to Amazon Keyspaces resources in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
    ///   - ttl: Enables Time to Live custom settings for the table. The options are:    status:enabled     status:disabled    The default is status:disabled. After ttl is enabled, you can't disable it for the table. For more information, see Expiring data by using Amazon Keyspaces Time to Live (TTL) in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.

    ///  Adds a new Amazon Web Services Region to the keyspace.  You can add a new Region to a keyspace that is either a single or a multi-Region keyspace. Amazon Keyspaces is going to replicate all tables in the keyspace to the new Region. To successfully replicate all tables to the new Region, they must use client-side timestamps for conflict resolution. To enable client-side timestamps, specify clientSideTimestamps.status = enabled when invoking the API. For more information about client-side timestamps, see Client-side timestamps in Amazon Keyspaces in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide. To add a Region to a keyspace using the UpdateKeyspace API, the IAM principal needs permissions for the following IAM actions:    cassandra:Alter     cassandra:AlterMultiRegionResource     cassandra:Create     cassandra:CreateMultiRegionResource     cassandra:Select     cassandra:SelectMultiRegionResource     cassandra:Modify     cassandra:ModifyMultiRegionResource    If the keyspace contains a table that is configured in provisioned mode with auto scaling enabled,  the following additional IAM actions need to be allowed.    application-autoscaling:RegisterScalableTarget     application-autoscaling:DeregisterScalableTarget     application-autoscaling:DescribeScalableTargets     application-autoscaling:PutScalingPolicy     application-autoscaling:DescribeScalingPolicies    To use the UpdateKeyspace API, the IAM principal also needs permissions to create a service-linked role with the following elements:    iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole - The action the principal can perform.    arn:aws:iam::*:role/aws-service-role/replication.cassandra.amazonaws.com/AWSServiceRoleForKeyspacesReplication - The resource that the action can be performed on.     iam:AWSServiceName: replication.cassandra.amazonaws.com - The only Amazon Web Services service that this role can be attached to is Amazon Keyspaces.   For more information, see Configure the IAM permissions required to add an Amazon Web Services Region to a keyspace in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.

    ///   - addColumns: For each column to be added to the specified table:    name  -  The name of the column.    type  -  An Amazon Keyspaces data type. For more information, see Data types in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
    ///   - autoScalingSpecification: The optional auto scaling settings to update for a table in provisioned capacity mode.  Specifies if the service can manage throughput capacity of a provisioned table  automatically on your behalf. Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling helps you provision throughput capacity for variable workloads efficiently by increasing and decreasing  your table's read and write capacity automatically in response to application traffic. If auto scaling is already enabled for the table, you can use UpdateTable to update the minimum and maximum values or the  auto scaling policy settings independently. For more information, see Managing throughput capacity automatically with Amazon Keyspaces auto scaling in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
    ///   - capacitySpecification: Modifies the read/write throughput capacity mode for the table. The options are:    throughputMode:PAY_PER_REQUEST and     throughputMode:PROVISIONED - Provisioned capacity mode requires readCapacityUnits and writeCapacityUnits as input.   The default is throughput_mode:PAY_PER_REQUEST. For more information, see Read/write capacity modes in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
    ///   - clientSideTimestamps: Enables client-side timestamps for the table. By default, the setting is disabled. You can enable  client-side timestamps with the following option:    status: "enabled"    Once client-side timestamps are enabled for a table, this setting cannot be disabled.
    ///   - defaultTimeToLive: The default Time to Live setting in seconds for the table. For more information, see Setting the default TTL value for a table in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
    ///   - encryptionSpecification: Modifies the encryption settings of the table. You can choose one of the following KMS key (KMS key):    type:AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY - This key is owned by Amazon Keyspaces.     type:CUSTOMER_MANAGED_KMS_KEY - This key is stored in your account and is created, owned, and managed by you.  This option  requires the kms_key_identifier of the KMS key in Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format as input.    The default is AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY. For more information, see Encryption at rest in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
    ///   - keyspaceName: The name of the keyspace the specified table is stored in.
    ///   - pointInTimeRecovery: Modifies the pointInTimeRecovery settings of the table. The options are:    status=ENABLED     status=DISABLED    If it's not specified, the default is status=DISABLED. For more information, see Point-in-time recovery in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
    ///   - replicaSpecifications: The Region specific settings of a multi-Regional table.
    ///   - tableName: The name of the table.
    ///   - ttl: Modifies Time to Live custom settings for the table. The options are:    status:enabled     status:disabled    The default is status:disabled. After ttl is enabled, you can't disable it for the table. For more information, see Expiring data by using Amazon Keyspaces Time to Live (TTL) in the Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide.
