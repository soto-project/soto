If SearchString includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.  If you're using the WAF API  Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes. For example, suppose the value of Type is HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent. If you want to search the User-Agent header for the value BadBot, you base64-encode BadBot using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, QmFkQm90, in the value of SearchString.

BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a Base64-encoded string, but use a forgiving implementation that ignores characters that aren't valid.  CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations. These are helpful in reducing effectiveness of attackers who inject an operating system command-line command and use unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command.    Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^    Delete spaces before the following characters: / (    Replace the following characters with a space: , ;    Replace multiple spaces with one space   Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)    COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE - Replace these characters with a space character (decimal 32):     \f, formfeed, decimal 12    \t, tab, decimal 9    \n, newline, decimal 10    \r, carriage return, decimal 13    \v, vertical tab, decimal 11   Non-breaking space, decimal 160    COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.  CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were encoded using CSS 2.x escape rules syndata.html#characters. This function uses up to two bytes in the decoding process, so it can help to uncover ASCII characters that were encoded using CSS encoding that wouldn’t typically be encoded. It's also useful in countering evasion, which is a combination of a backslash and non-hexadecimal characters. For example, ja\vascript for javascript.   ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following ANSI C escape sequences: \a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, \v, \\, \?, \', \", \xHH (hexadecimal), \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't valid remain in the output.   HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadecimal characters into a binary.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE - Replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these operations:    Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "    Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160   Replaces (ampersand)lt; with a "less than" symbol   Replaces (ampersand)gt; with &gt;    Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;, with the corresponding characters   Replaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn;, with the corresponding characters    JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape sequences. If a \ u HHHH code is in the full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E, then the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. If not, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed, causing a possible loss of information.   LOWERCASE - Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).   MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash from the data in the input. The computed hash is in a raw binary form.   NONE - Specify NONE if you don't want any text transformations.   NORMALIZE_PATH - Remove multiple slashes, directory self-references, and directory back-references that are not at the beginning of the input from an input string.   NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as NORMALIZE_PATH, but first converts backslash characters to forward slashes.   REMOVE_NULLS - Remove all NULL bytes from the input.   REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace each occurrence of a C-style comment (/* ... */) with a single space. Multiple consecutive occurrences are not compressed. Unterminated comments are also replaced with a space (ASCII 0x20). However, a standalone termination of a comment (*/) is not acted upon.   REPLACE_NULLS - Replace NULL bytes in the input with space characters (ASCII 0x20).   SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode the following ANSI C escape sequences: \a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t, \v, \\, \?, \', \", \xHH (hexadecimal), \0OOO (octal). Encodings that aren't valid remain in the output.  URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.   URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE, but with support for Microsoft-specific %u encoding. If the code is in the full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E, the higher byte is used to detect and adjust the lower byte. Otherwise, only the lower byte is used and the higher byte is zeroed.   UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all UTF-8 character sequences to Unicode. This helps input normalization, and minimizing false-positives and false-negatives for non-English languages.
