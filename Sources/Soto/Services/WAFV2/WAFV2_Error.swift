The policy specifications must conform to the following:   The policy must be composed using IAM Policy version 2012-10-17 or version 2015-01-01.   The policy must include specifications for Effect, Action, and Principal.    Effect must specify Allow.    Action must specify wafv2:CreateWebACL, wafv2:UpdateWebACL, and  wafv2:PutFirewallManagerRuleGroups and may optionally specify wafv2:GetRuleGroup.
