/// Service object for interacting with AWS WAFV2 service.
///
/// WAF  This is the latest version of the WAF API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements. If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF resources that you created before. WAF Classic support will end on September 30, 2025.  For information about WAF, including how to migrate your WAF Classic resources to this version, see the WAF Developer Guide.   WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, or Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response.  This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using  WAF, see the WAF Developer Guide. You can make calls using the endpoints listed in WAF endpoints and quotas.    For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.    For Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.   Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs.

A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.   For Amazon CloudFront, don't use this call. Instead, use your CloudFront distribution configuration. To associate a web ACL, in the CloudFront call UpdateDistribution, set the web ACL ID to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL.

Required permissions for customer-managed IAM policies  This call requires permissions that are specific to the protected resource type.  For details, see Permissions for AssociateWebACL in the WAF Developer Guide.   Temporary inconsistencies during updates  When you create or change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes.  The following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during change propagation:    After you create a web ACL, if you try to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception indicating that the web ACL is unavailable.    After you add a rule group to a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in another.   After you change a rule action setting, you might see the old action in some places and the new action in others.    After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking rule, the new address might be blocked in one area while still allowed in another.

    ///   - captchaConfig: Specifies how WAF should handle CAPTCHA evaluations for rules that don't have their own CaptchaConfig settings. If you don't specify this, WAF uses its default settings for CaptchaConfig.
    ///   - challengeConfig: Specifies how WAF should handle challenge evaluations for rules that don't have
    ///   - customResponseBodies: A map of custom response keys and content bodies. When you create a rule with a block action, you can send a custom response to the web request. You define these for the web ACL, and then use them in the rules and default actions that you define in the web ACL.  For information about customizing web requests and responses,  see Customizing web requests and responses in WAF  in the WAF Developer Guide.  For information about the limits on count and size for custom request and response settings, see WAF quotas  in the WAF Developer Guide.
    ///   - defaultAction: The action to perform if none of the Rules contained in the WebACL match.
    ///   - description: A description of the web ACL that helps with identification.
    ///   - id: The unique identifier for the web ACL. This ID is returned in the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to operations like update and delete.
    ///   - lockToken: A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity associated with the token, you provide the token to operations like update and delete. WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException. If this happens, perform another get, and use the new token returned by that operation.
    ///   - name: The name of the web ACL. You cannot change the name of a web ACL after you create it.
    ///   - rules: The Rule statements used to identify the web requests that you  want to manage. Each rule includes one top-level statement that WAF uses to identify matching   web requests, and parameters that govern how WAF handles them.
    ///   - scope: Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or for a regional application. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.   To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East (N. Virginia) as follows:    CLI - Specify the Region when you use the CloudFront scope: --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1.    API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.
    ///   - tokenDomains: Specifies the domains that WAF should accept in a web request token. This enables the use of tokens across multiple protected websites. When WAF provides a token, it uses the domain of the Amazon Web Services resource that the web ACL is protecting. If you don't specify a list of token domains, WAF accepts tokens only for the domain of the protected resource. With a token domain list, WAF accepts the resource's host domain plus all domains in the token domain list, including their prefixed subdomains. Example JSON: "TokenDomains": { "mywebsite.com", "myotherwebsite.com" }  Public suffixes aren't allowed. For example, you can't use gov.au or co.uk as token domains.
