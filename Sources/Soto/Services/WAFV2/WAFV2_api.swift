/// Service object for interacting with AWS WAFV2 service.
///
/// WAF   This is the latest version of the WAF API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements. If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF resources that you created before. WAF Classic support will end on September 30, 2025.  For information about WAF, including how to migrate your WAF Classic resources to this version, see the WAF Developer Guide.   WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to a protected resource. Protected resource types include Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, Amplify application, and Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response.  This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using  WAF, see the WAF Developer Guide. You can make calls using the endpoints listed in WAF endpoints and quotas.    For regional resources, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.    For Amazon CloudFront and Amplify, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.   Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs.

For Amazon CloudFront, call UpdateDistribution for the distribution and provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL in the web ACL ID. For information, see UpdateDistribution in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.   Required permissions for customer-managed IAM policies  This call requires permissions that are specific to the protected resource type.  For details, see Permissions for AssociateWebACL in the WAF Developer Guide.   Temporary inconsistencies during updates  When you create or change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes.  The following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during change propagation:    After you create a web ACL, if you try to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception indicating that the web ACL is unavailable.    After you add a rule group to a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in another.   After you change a rule action setting, you might see the old action in some places and the new action in others.    After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking rule, the new address might be blocked in one area while still allowed in another.
