/// Service object for interacting with AWS WAFV2 service.
///
/// WAF  This is the latest version of the WAF API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements. If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces.  For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to this version, see the WAF Developer Guide.   WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, or Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response.  This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using  WAF, see the WAF Developer Guide. You can make calls using the endpoints listed in WAF endpoints and quotas.    For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.    For Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.   Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs. We currently provide two versions of the WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements:   You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a Scope parameter and set it to CLOUDFRONT or REGIONAL.    You can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or web ACL calls.   The limits WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.

    // MARK: API Calls

    /// Associates a web ACL with a regional application resource, to protect the resource. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.   For Amazon CloudFront, don't use this call. Instead, use your CloudFront distribution configuration. To associate a web ACL, in the CloudFront call UpdateDistribution, set the web ACL ID to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL. For information, see UpdateDistribution in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.   Required permissions for customer-managed IAM policies  This call requires permissions that are specific to the protected resource type.  For details, see Permissions for AssociateWebACL in the WAF Developer Guide.   Temporary inconsistencies during updates  When you create or change a web ACL or other WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be from a few seconds to a number of minutes.  The following are examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during change propagation:    After you create a web ACL, if you try to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception indicating that the web ACL is unavailable.    After you add a rule group to a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in another.   After you change a rule action setting, you might see the old action in some places and the new action in others.    After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking rule, the new address might be blocked in one area while still allowed in another.

    /// Enables the specified LoggingConfiguration, to start logging from a web ACL, according to the configuration provided.   This operation completely replaces any mutable specifications that you already have for a logging configuration with the ones that you provide to this call.  To modify an existing logging configuration, do the following:    Retrieve it by calling GetLoggingConfiguration    Update its settings as needed   Provide the complete logging configuration specification to this call     You can define one logging destination per web ACL.  You can access information about the traffic that WAF inspects using the following steps:   Create your logging destination. You can use an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group, an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, or an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.  The name that you give the destination must start with aws-waf-logs-. Depending on the type of destination, you might need to configure additional settings or permissions.  For configuration requirements and pricing information for each destination type, see  Logging web ACL traffic  in the WAF Developer Guide.   Associate your logging destination to your web ACL using a PutLoggingConfiguration request.   When you successfully enable logging using a PutLoggingConfiguration request, WAF creates an additional role or policy that is required to write logs to the logging destination. For an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group, WAF creates a resource policy on the log group. For an Amazon S3 bucket, WAF creates a bucket policy. For an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, WAF creates a service-linked role. For additional information about web ACL logging, see  Logging web ACL traffic information  in the WAF Developer Guide.
