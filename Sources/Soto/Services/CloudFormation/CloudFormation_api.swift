/// Service object for interacting with AWS CloudFormation service.

/// CloudFormation CloudFormation allows you to create and manage Amazon Web Services infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use CloudFormation to leverage Amazon Web Services products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to build highly reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying Amazon Web Services infrastructure. With CloudFormation, you declare all your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you. For more information about CloudFormation, see the CloudFormation product page. CloudFormation makes use of other Amazon Web Services products. If you need additional technical information about a specific Amazon Web Services product, you can find the product's technical documentation at docs.aws.amazon.com.

    ///   - clientRequestToken: A unique identifier for this ContinueUpdateRollback request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to continue the rollback to a stack with the same name. You might retry ContinueUpdateRollback requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.
    ///   - resourcesToSkip: A list of the logical IDs of the resources that CloudFormation skips during the continue update rollback operation. You can specify only resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED state because a rollback failed. You can't specify resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED state for other reasons, for example, because an update was canceled. To check why a resource update failed, use the DescribeStackResources action, and view the resource status reason.  Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you  troubleshoot resources before skipping them. CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to UPDATE_COMPLETE and continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack template. Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.  Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources. To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following format: NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID. If you want to specify the logical ID of a stack resource (Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack) in the ResourcesToSkip list, then its corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states: DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, DELETE_COMPLETE, or DELETE_FAILED.  Don't confuse a child stack's name with its corresponding logical ID defined in the parent stack. For an example of a continue update rollback operation with nested stacks, see Continue rolling back from failed nested stack updates.
    ///   - roleARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that CloudFormation assumes to roll back the stack. CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least permission. If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated from your user credentials.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - capabilities: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group     AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User     AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.  This capacity doesn't apply to creating change sets, and specifying it when creating change sets has no effect. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create or update the stack directly from the template using the CreateStack or UpdateStack action, and specifying this capability.  For more information about macros, see Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros.    Only one of the Capabilities and ResourceType parameters can be specified.
    ///   - changeSetName: The name of the change set. The name must be unique among all change sets that are associated with the specified stack. A change set name can contain only alphanumeric, case sensitive characters, and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetical character and can't exceed 128 characters.
    ///   - changeSetType: The type of change set operation. To create a change set for a new stack, specify CREATE. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify UPDATE. To create a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT. If you create a change set for a new stack, CloudFormation creates a stack with a unique stack ID, but no template or resources. The stack will be in the REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS state until you execute the change set. By default, CloudFormation specifies UPDATE. You can't use the UPDATE type to create a change set for a new stack or the CREATE type to create a change set for an existing stack.

    ///   - onStackFailure: Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. If this parameter is specified, the DisableRollback parameter to the ExecuteChangeSet API operation must not be specified. This must be one of these values:    DELETE - Deletes the change set if the stack creation fails. This is only valid when the ChangeSetType parameter is set to CREATE. If the deletion of the stack fails, the status of the stack is DELETE_FAILED.    DO_NOTHING - if the stack creation fails, do nothing. This is equivalent to specifying true for the DisableRollback parameter to the ExecuteChangeSet API operation.    ROLLBACK - if the stack creation fails, roll back the stack. This is equivalent to specifying false for the DisableRollback parameter to the ExecuteChangeSet API operation.   For nested stacks, when the OnStackFailure parameter is set to DELETE for the change set for the parent stack, any failure in a child stack will cause the parent stack creation to fail and all stacks to be deleted.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - capabilities: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.    AWS::IAM::AccessKey     AWS::IAM::Group     AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy     AWS::IAM::Policy     AWS::IAM::Role     AWS::IAM::User     AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros.    Only one of the Capabilities and ResourceType parameters can be specified.
    ///   - clientRequestToken: A unique identifier for this CreateStack request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create a stack with the same name. You might retry CreateStack requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them. All events initiated by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.
    ///   - disableRollback: Set to true to disable rollback of the stack if stack creation failed. You can specify either DisableRollback or OnFailure, but not both. Default: false

If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the operation fails and the stack remains unchanged. For more information, see Protect CloudFormation stacks from being deleted in the CloudFormation User Guide. Termination protection is deactivated on stacks by default. For nested stacks, termination protection is set on the root stack and can't be changed directly on the nested stack.

Use the following syntax to describe template resource types: AWS::* (for all Amazon Web Services resources), Custom::* (for all custom resources), Custom::logical_ID (for a specific custom resource), AWS::service_name::* (for all resources of a particular Amazon Web Services service), and AWS::service_name::resource_logical_ID (for a specific Amazon Web Services resource). If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're creating, the stack creation fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. IAM uses this parameter for CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see Control access with Identity and Access Management.  Only one of the Capabilities and ResourceType parameters can be specified.

    ///   - administrationRoleARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to use to create this stack set. Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized administrator roles to control which users or groups can manage specific stack sets within the same administrator account. For more information, see Grant self-managed permissions in the CloudFormation User Guide. Valid only if the permissions model is SELF_MANAGED.
    ///   - autoDeployment: Describes whether StackSets automatically deploys to Organizations accounts that are added to the target organization or organizational unit (OU). For more information, see Manage automatic deployments for CloudFormation StackSets that use service-managed permissions in the CloudFormation User Guide. Required if the permissions model is SERVICE_MANAGED. (Not used with self-managed permissions.)
    ///   - callAs: Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account. By default, SELF is specified. Use SELF for stack sets with self-managed permissions.   To create a stack set with service-managed permissions while signed in to the management account, specify SELF.   To create a stack set with service-managed permissions while signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN. Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered as a delegated admin in the management account. For more information, see Register a delegated administrator in the CloudFormation User Guide.   Stack sets with service-managed permissions are created in the management account, including stack sets that are created by delegated administrators. Valid only if the permissions model is SERVICE_MANAGED.
    ///   - capabilities: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack set template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack set and related stack instances.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stack sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.    AWS::IAM::AccessKey     AWS::IAM::Group     AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile     AWS::IAM::Policy     AWS::IAM::Role     AWS::IAM::User     AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some templates reference macros. If your stack set template references one or more macros, you must create the stack set directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set. To create the stack set directly, you must acknowledge this capability. For more information, see Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros.  Stack sets with service-managed permissions don't currently support the use of macros in templates. (This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability for a stack set with service-managed permissions, if you reference a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail.
    ///   - clientRequestToken: A unique identifier for this CreateStackSet request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create another stack set with the same name. You might retry CreateStackSet requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them. If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically.
    ///   - description: A description of the stack set. You can use the description to identify the stack set's purpose or other important information.
    ///   - executionRoleName: The name of the IAM execution role to use to create the stack set. If you do not specify an execution role, CloudFormation uses the AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role for the stack set operation. Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized execution roles to control which stack resources users and groups can include in their stack sets. Valid only if the permissions model is SELF_MANAGED.
    ///   - managedExecution: Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations concurrently and queues conflicting operations.
    ///   - parameters: The input parameters for the stack set template.
    ///   - permissionModel: Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations are created. By default, SELF-MANAGED is specified.   With self-managed permissions, you must create the administrator and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For more information, see Grant self-managed permissions.   With service-managed permissions, StackSets automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by Organizations. For more information, see Activate trusted access for stack sets with Organizations.
    ///   - stackId: The stack ID you are importing into a new stack set. Specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stack.
    ///   - stackSetName: The name to associate with the stack set. The name must be unique in the Region where you create your stack set.  A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case-sensitive) and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and can't be longer than 128 characters.
    ///   - tags: The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the stacks created from it. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources that are created in the stacks. A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified. If you specify tags as part of a CreateStackSet action, CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission to tag resources. If you don't, the entire CreateStackSet action fails with an access denied error, and the stack set is not created.
    ///   - templateBody: The structure that contains the template body, with a minimum length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the TemplateURL parameter, but not both.
    ///   - templateURL: The URL of a file that contains the template body. The URL must point to a template (maximum size: 1 MB) that's located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Manager document. The location for an Amazon S3 bucket must start with https://. Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the TemplateURL parameter, but not both.

For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.

    ///   - clientRequestToken: A unique identifier that acts as an idempotency key for this registration request. Specifying a client request token prevents CloudFormation from generating more than one version of an extension from the same registration request, even if the request is submitted multiple times.

For CloudFormation to assume the specified execution role, the role must contain a trust relationship with the CloudFormation service principal (resources.cloudformation.amazonaws.com). For more information about adding trust relationships, see Modifying a role trust policy in the Identity and Access Management User Guide. If your extension calls Amazon Web Services APIs in any of its handlers, you must create an  IAM execution role that includes the necessary permissions to call those Amazon Web Services APIs, and provision that execution role in your account. When CloudFormation needs to invoke the resource type handler, CloudFormation assumes this execution role to create a temporary session token, which it then passes to the resource type handler, thereby supplying your resource type with the appropriate credentials.

The user registering the extension must be able to access the package in the S3 bucket. That's, the user needs to have GetObject permissions for the schema handler package.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - capabilities: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to update the stack.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account, for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group     AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy     AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User     AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros.    Only one of the Capabilities and ResourceType parameters can be specified.
    ///   - clientRequestToken: A unique identifier for this UpdateStack request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to update a stack with the same name. You might retry UpdateStack requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them. All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.

If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types.

If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

If you specify accounts, you must also specify the Amazon Web Services Regions in which to update stack set instances. To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, don't specify the Accounts or Regions properties. If the stack set update includes changes to the template (that is, if the TemplateBody or TemplateURL properties are specified), or the Parameters property, CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of OUTDATED prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions. If the stack set update does not include changes to the template or parameters, CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions, while leaving all other stack instances with their existing stack instance status.
    ///   - administrationRoleARN: [Self-managed permissions] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to use to update this stack set. Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized administrator roles to control which users or groups can manage specific stack sets within the same administrator account. For more information, see Grant self-managed permissions in the CloudFormation User Guide. If you specified a customized administrator role when you created the stack set, you must specify a customized administrator role, even if it is the same customized administrator role used with this stack set previously.
    ///   - autoDeployment: [Service-managed permissions] Describes whether StackSets automatically deploys to Organizations accounts that are added to a target organization or organizational unit (OU). For more information, see Manage automatic deployments for CloudFormation StackSets that use service-managed permissions in the CloudFormation User Guide. If you specify AutoDeployment, don't specify DeploymentTargets or Regions.
    ///   - callAs: [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an account administrator in the organization's management account or as a delegated administrator in a member account. By default, SELF is specified. Use SELF for stack sets with self-managed permissions.   If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF.   If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN. Your Amazon Web Services account must be registered as a delegated administrator in the management account. For more information, see Register a delegated administrator in the CloudFormation User Guide.
    ///   - capabilities: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to update the stack set and its associated stack instances.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account, for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks sets, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.    AWS::IAM::AccessKey     AWS::IAM::Group     AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile     AWS::IAM::Policy     AWS::IAM::Role     AWS::IAM::User     AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some templates reference macros. If your stack set template references one or more macros, you must update the stack set directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set. To update the stack set directly, you must acknowledge this capability. For more information, see Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros.  Stack sets with service-managed permissions do not currently support the use of macros in templates. (This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability for a stack set with service-managed permissions, if you reference a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail.
    ///   - deploymentTargets: [Service-managed permissions] The Organizations accounts in which to update associated stack instances. To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do not specify DeploymentTargets or Regions. If the stack set update includes changes to the template (that is, if TemplateBody or TemplateURL is specified), or the Parameters, CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of OUTDATED prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions. If the stack set update doesn't include changes to the template or parameters, CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other stack instances with their existing stack instance status.
    ///   - description: A brief description of updates that you are making.
    ///   - executionRoleName: [Self-managed permissions] The name of the IAM execution role to use to update the stack set. If you do not specify an execution role, CloudFormation uses the AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role for the stack set operation. Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized execution roles to control which stack resources users and groups can include in their stack sets. If you specify a customized execution role, CloudFormation uses that role to update the stack. If you do not specify a customized execution role, CloudFormation performs the update using the role previously associated with the stack set, so long as you have permissions to perform operations on the stack set.
    ///   - managedExecution: Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations concurrently and queues conflicting operations.
    ///   - operationId: The unique ID for this stack set operation. The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token, to ensure that CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry stack set operation requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them. If you don't specify an operation ID, CloudFormation generates one automatically. Repeating this stack set operation with a new operation ID retries all stack instances whose status is OUTDATED.
    ///   - operationPreferences: Preferences for how CloudFormation performs this stack set operation.
    ///   - parameters: A list of input parameters for the stack set template.
    ///   - permissionModel: Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations are created. You cannot modify PermissionModel if there are stack instances associated with your stack set.   With self-managed permissions, you must create the administrator and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For more information, see Grant self-managed permissions.   With service-managed permissions, StackSets automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by Organizations. For more information, see Activate trusted access for stack sets with Organizations.
    ///   - regions: The Amazon Web Services Regions in which to update associated stack instances. If you specify Regions, you must also specify accounts in which to update stack set instances. To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do not specify the Accounts or Regions properties. If the stack set update includes changes to the template (that is, if the TemplateBody or TemplateURL properties are specified), or the Parameters property, CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a status of OUTDATED prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions. If the stack set update does not include changes to the template or parameters, CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving all other stack instances with their existing stack instance status.
    ///   - stackSetName: The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to update.
    ///   - tags: The key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the stacks created from it. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources that are created in the stacks. You can specify a maximum number of 50 tags. If you specify tags for this parameter, those tags replace any list of tags that are currently associated with this stack set. This means:   If you don't specify this parameter, CloudFormation doesn't modify the stack's tags.   If you specify any tags using this parameter, you must specify all the tags that you want associated with this stack set, even tags you've specified before (for example, when creating the stack set or during a previous update of the stack set.). Any tags that you don't include in the updated list of tags are removed from the stack set, and therefore from the stacks and resources as well.   If you specify an empty value, CloudFormation removes all currently associated tags.   If you specify new tags as part of an UpdateStackSet action, CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission to tag resources. If you omit tags that are currently associated with the stack set from the list of tags you specify, CloudFormation assumes that you want to remove those tags from the stack set, and checks to see if you have permission to untag resources. If you don't have the necessary permission(s), the entire UpdateStackSet action fails with an access denied error, and the stack set is not updated.

This requires ListStacks and DescribeStacks permissions. Consider using the ListStacks API if you're not passing a parameter to StackName. The IAM policy below can be added to IAM policies when you want to limit resource-level permissions and avoid returning a response when no parameter is sent in the request: { "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": [{ "Effect": "Deny", "Action": "cloudformation:DescribeStacks", "NotResource": "arn:aws:cloudformation:*:*:stack/*/*" }] }  The name or the unique stack ID that's associated with the stack, which aren't always interchangeable:   Running stacks: You can specify either the stack's name or its unique stack ID.   Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.
