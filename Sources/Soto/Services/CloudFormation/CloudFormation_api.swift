/// Service object for interacting with AWS CloudFormation service.

/// CloudFormation CloudFormation allows you to create and manage Amazon Web Services infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use CloudFormation to leverage Amazon Web Services products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to build highly reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying Amazon Web Services infrastructure. With CloudFormation, you declare all your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you. For more information about CloudFormation, see the CloudFormation product page. CloudFormation makes use of other Amazon Web Services products. If you need additional technical information about a specific Amazon Web Services product, you can find the product's technical documentation at docs.aws.amazon.com.

    ///   - clientRequestToken: A unique identifier for this ContinueUpdateRollback request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to continue the rollback to a stack with the same name. You might retry ContinueUpdateRollback requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.
    ///   - resourcesToSkip: A list of the logical IDs of the resources that CloudFormation skips during the continue update rollback operation. You can specify only resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED state because a rollback failed. You can't specify resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED state for other reasons, for example, because an update was canceled. To check why a resource update failed, use the DescribeStackResources action, and view the resource status reason.  Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you  troubleshoot resources before skipping them. CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to UPDATE_COMPLETE and continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack template. Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.  Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources. To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following format: NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID. If you want to specify the logical ID of a stack resource (Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack) in the ResourcesToSkip list, then its corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states: DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, DELETE_COMPLETE, or DELETE_FAILED.  Don't confuse a child stack's name with its corresponding logical ID defined in the parent stack. For an example of a continue update rollback operation with nested stacks, see Continue rolling back from failed nested stack updates.
    ///   - roleARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that CloudFormation assumes to roll back the stack. CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least permission. If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that's generated from your user credentials.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - capabilities: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group     AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile      AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User     AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.  This capacity doesn't apply to creating change sets, and specifying it when creating change sets has no effect. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create or update the stack directly from the template using the CreateStack or UpdateStack action, and specifying this capability.  For more information about macros, see Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros.    Only one of the Capabilities and ResourceType parameters can be specified.
    ///   - changeSetName: The name of the change set. The name must be unique among all change sets that are associated with the specified stack.

    ///   - changeSetType: The type of change set operation. To create a change set for a new stack, specify CREATE. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify UPDATE. To create a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT. If you create a change set for a new stack, CloudFormation creates a stack with a unique stack ID, but no template or resources. The stack will be in the REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS state until you execute the change set. By default, CloudFormation specifies UPDATE. You can't use the UPDATE type to create a change set for a new stack or the CREATE type to create a change set for an existing stack.

    ///   - onStackFailure: Determines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. If this parameter is specified, the DisableRollback parameter to the ExecuteChangeSet API operation must not be specified. This must be one of these values:    DELETE - Deletes the change set if the stack creation fails. This is only valid when the ChangeSetType parameter is set to CREATE. If the deletion of the stack fails, the status of the stack is DELETE_FAILED.    DO_NOTHING - if the stack creation fails, do nothing. This is equivalent to specifying true for the DisableRollback parameter to the ExecuteChangeSet API operation.    ROLLBACK - if the stack creation fails, roll back the stack. This is equivalent to specifying false for the DisableRollback parameter to the ExecuteChangeSet API operation.   For nested stacks, when the OnStackFailure parameter is set to DELETE for the change set for the parent stack, any failure in a child stack will cause the parent stack creation to fail and all stacks to be deleted.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - capabilities: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to create the stack.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account; for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.    AWS::IAM::AccessKey     AWS::IAM::Group     AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile     AWS::IAM::Policy     AWS::IAM::Role     AWS::IAM::User     AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros.    Only one of the Capabilities and ResourceType parameters can be specified.
    ///   - clientRequestToken: A unique identifier for this CreateStack request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create a stack with the same name. You might retry CreateStack requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them. All events initiated by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.
    ///   - disableRollback: Set to true to disable rollback of the stack if stack creation failed. You can specify either DisableRollback or OnFailure, but not both. Default: false

If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the operation fails and the stack remains unchanged. For more information, see Protect CloudFormation stacks from being deleted in the CloudFormation User Guide. Termination protection is deactivated on stacks by default. For nested stacks, termination protection is set on the root stack and can't be changed directly on the nested stack.

If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're creating, the stack creation fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. IAM uses this parameter for CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see Control access with Identity and Access Management.  Only one of the Capabilities and ResourceType parameters can be specified.

If your stack set template references one or more macros, you must create the stack set directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set. To create the stack set directly, you must acknowledge this capability. For more information, see Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.  Stack sets with service-managed permissions don't currently support the use of macros in templates. (This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability for a stack set with service-managed permissions, if you reference a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail.
    ///   - clientRequestToken: A unique identifier for this CreateStackSet request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to create another stack set with the same name. You might retry CreateStackSet requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them. If you don't specify an operation ID, the SDK generates one automatically.
    ///   - description: A description of the stack set. You can use the description to identify the stack set's purpose or other important information.
    ///   - executionRoleName: The name of the IAM execution role to use to create the stack set. If you do not specify an execution role, CloudFormation uses the AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role for the stack set operation. Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized execution roles to control which stack resources users and groups can include in their stack sets.
    ///   - managedExecution: Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations concurrently and queues conflicting operations.
    ///   - parameters: The input parameters for the stack set template.
    ///   - permissionModel: Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations are created. By default, SELF-MANAGED is specified.   With self-managed permissions, you must create the administrator and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts. For more information, see Grant Self-Managed Stack Set Permissions.   With service-managed permissions, StackSets automatically creates the IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by Organizations. For more information, see Grant Service-Managed Stack Set Permissions.
    ///   - stackId: The stack ID you are importing into a new stack set. Specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stack.

A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified. If you specify tags as part of a CreateStackSet action, CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission to tag resources. If you don't, the entire CreateStackSet action fails with an access denied error, and the stack set is not created.

You can have a maximum of 50 resource extension versions registered at a time. This maximum is per account and per Region. Use DeregisterType to deregister specific extension versions if necessary. Once you have initiated a registration request using RegisterType, you can use DescribeTypeRegistration to monitor the progress of the registration request. Once you have registered a private extension in your account and Region, use SetTypeConfiguration to specify configuration properties for the extension. For more information, see Edit configuration data for extensions in your account in the CloudFormation User Guide.
    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - clientRequestToken: A unique identifier that acts as an idempotency key for this registration request. Specifying a client request token prevents CloudFormation from generating more than one version of an extension from the same registration request, even if the request is submitted multiple times.
    ///   - executionRoleArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for CloudFormation to assume when invoking the extension. For CloudFormation to assume the specified execution role, the role must contain a trust relationship with the CloudFormation service principal (resources.cloudformation.amazonaws.com). For more information about adding trust relationships, see Modifying a role trust policy in the Identity and Access Management User Guide. If your extension calls Amazon Web Services APIs in any of its handlers, you must create an  IAM execution role that includes the necessary permissions to call those Amazon Web Services APIs, and provision that execution role in your account. When CloudFormation needs to invoke the resource type handler, CloudFormation assumes this execution role to create a temporary session token, which it then passes to the resource type handler, thereby supplying your resource type with the appropriate credentials.
    ///   - loggingConfig: Specifies logging configuration information for an extension.
    ///   - schemaHandlerPackage: A URL to the S3 bucket containing the extension project package that contains the necessary files for the extension you want to register. For information about generating a schema handler package for the extension you want to register, see submit in the CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI) User Guide.  The user registering the extension must be able to access the package in the S3 bucket. That's, the user needs to have GetObject permissions for the schema handler package. For more information, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3 in the Identity and Access Management User Guide.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - capabilities: In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack template contains certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to update the stack.    CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon Web Services account, for example, by creating new IAM users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.   If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.   If you don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.     AWS::IAM::AccessKey      AWS::IAM::Group     AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile     AWS::IAM::Policy      AWS::IAM::Role      AWS::IAM::User     AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition    For more information, see Acknowledging IAM resources in CloudFormation templates.    CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Perform custom processing on CloudFormation templates with template macros.    Only one of the Capabilities and ResourceType parameters can be specified.
    ///   - clientRequestToken: A unique identifier for this UpdateStack request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you're not attempting to update a stack with the same name. You might retry UpdateStack requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them. All events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1, then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1. In the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID, which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002.

If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're updating, the stack update fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. IAM uses this parameter for CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see Control access with Identity and Access Management.  Only one of the Capabilities and ResourceType parameters can be specified.
    ///   - retainExceptOnCreate: When set to true, newly created resources are deleted when the operation rolls back. This includes newly created resources marked with a deletion policy of Retain. Default: false
    ///   - roleARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that CloudFormation assumes to update the stack. CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. Provided that users have permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege. If you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.

If you specify new tags as part of an UpdateStackSet action, CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission to tag resources. If you omit tags that are currently associated with the stack set from the list of tags you specify, CloudFormation assumes that you want to remove those tags from the stack set, and checks to see if you have permission to untag resources. If you don't have the necessary permission(s), the entire UpdateStackSet action fails with an access denied error, and the stack set is not updated.

    ///   - deprecatedStatus: The deprecation status of the extension that you want to get summary information about. Valid values include:    LIVE: The extension is registered for use in CloudFormation operations.    DEPRECATED: The extension has been deregistered and can no longer be used in CloudFormation operations.
    ///   - filters: Filter criteria to use in determining which extensions to return. Filters must be compatible with Visibility to return valid results. For example, specifying AWS_TYPES for Category and PRIVATE for Visibility returns an empty list of types, but specifying PUBLIC for Visibility returns the desired list.
    ///   - maxResults: The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call. If the number of available results exceeds this maximum, the response includes a NextToken value that you can assign to the NextToken request parameter to get the next set of results.
    ///   - provisioningType: For resource types, the provisioning behavior of the resource type. CloudFormation determines the provisioning type during registration, based on the types of handlers in the schema handler package submitted. Valid values include:    FULLY_MUTABLE: The resource type includes an update handler to process updates to the type during stack update operations.    IMMUTABLE: The resource type doesn't include an update handler, so the type can't be updated and must instead be replaced during stack update operations.    NON_PROVISIONABLE: The resource type doesn't include create, read, and delete handlers, and therefore can't actually be provisioned.   The default is FULLY_MUTABLE.
    ///   - type: The type of extension.
    ///   - visibility: The scope at which the extensions are visible and usable in CloudFormation operations. Valid values include:    PRIVATE: Extensions that are visible and usable within this account and Region. This includes:   Private extensions you have registered in this account and Region.   Public extensions that you have activated in this account and Region.      PUBLIC: Extensions that are publicly visible and available to be activated within any Amazon Web Services account. This includes extensions from Amazon Web Services, in addition to third-party publishers.   The default is PRIVATE.
