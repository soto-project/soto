Depending on the cause of the failure, you can manually  fix the error and continue the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can return your stack to a working state (the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state), and then try to update the stack again. A stack goes into the UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED state when CloudFormation can't roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, you might have a stack that's rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of CloudFormation. Because CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.

If you create a change set for an existing stack, CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which resources CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack. To create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, for the ChangeSetType parameter, specify CREATE. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify UPDATE for the ChangeSetType parameter. To create a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT for the ChangeSetType parameter. After the CreateChangeSet call successfully completes, CloudFormation starts creating the change set. To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the DescribeChangeSet action.
