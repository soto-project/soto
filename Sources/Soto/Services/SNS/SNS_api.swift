/// Service object for interacting with AWS SNS service.
///
/// Amazon Simple Notification Service Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see the Amazon SNS product page. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.  For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see Identity and access management in Amazon SNS in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.  We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to Tools for Amazon Web Services.

    ///   - attributes: A map of attributes with their corresponding values. The following lists names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the CreateTopic action uses:    DeliveryPolicy – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.    DisplayName – The display name to use for a topic with SMS subscriptions.    FifoTopic – Set to true to create a FIFO topic.    Policy – The policy that defines who can access your topic. By default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.    SignatureVersion – The signature version corresponds to the hashing algorithm used while creating the signature of the notifications, subscription confirmations, or unsubscribe confirmation messages sent by Amazon SNS. By default, SignatureVersion is set to 1.    TracingConfig – Tracing mode of an Amazon SNS topic. By default TracingConfig is set to PassThrough, and the topic passes through the tracing header it receives from an Amazon SNS publisher to its subscriptions. If set to Active, Amazon SNS will vend X-Ray segment data to topic owner account if the sampled flag in the tracing header is true. This is only supported on standard topics.   The following attribute applies only to server-side encryption:    KmsMasterKeyId – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms. For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Management Service API Reference.    The following attributes apply only to FIFO topics:    ArchivePolicy – The policy that sets the retention period for messages stored in the message archive of an Amazon SNS FIFO topic.    ContentBasedDeduplication – Enables content-based deduplication for FIFO topics.   By default, ContentBasedDeduplication is set to false. If you create a FIFO topic and this attribute is false, you must specify a value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the Publish action.    When you set ContentBasedDeduplication to true, Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message). (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the Publish action.        FifoThroughputScope – Enables higher throughput for your FIFO topic by adjusting the scope of deduplication. This attribute has two possible values:    Topic – The scope of message deduplication is across the entire topic. This is the default value and maintains existing behavior, with a maximum throughput of 3000 messages per second or 20MB per second, whichever comes first.    MessageGroup – The scope of deduplication is within each individual message group, which enables higher throughput per topic subject to regional quotas. For more information on quotas or to request an increase, see Amazon SNS service quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - message: The message you want to send. If you are publishing to a topic and you want to send the same message to all transport protocols, include the text of the message as a String value. If you want to send different messages for each transport protocol, set the value of the MessageStructure parameter to json and use a JSON object for the Message parameter.    Constraints:   With the exception of SMS, messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings and at most 256 KB in size (262,144 bytes, not 262,144 characters).   For SMS, each message can contain up to 140 characters. This character limit depends on the encoding schema. For example, an SMS message can contain 160 GSM characters, 140 ASCII characters, or 70 UCS-2 characters. If you publish a message that exceeds this size limit, Amazon SNS sends the message as multiple messages, each fitting within the size limit. Messages aren't truncated mid-word but are cut off at whole-word boundaries. The total size limit for a single SMS Publish action is 1,600 characters.   JSON-specific constraints:   Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported transport protocols must have simple JSON string values.   The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in outgoing messages.   Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the characters will be reescaped for sending).   Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, "", is allowed).   Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes).   Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored.   Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are ignored.   Duplicate keys are not allowed.   Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will cause the Publish call to return an error (no partial delivery).
    ///   - messageAttributes: Message attributes for Publish action.
    ///   - messageDeduplicationId:   This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) topics. The MessageDeduplicationId can contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;?@[\]^_`{|}~).   Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId, which is a token used for deduplication of sent messages within the 5 minute minimum deduplication interval.   The scope of deduplication depends on the FifoThroughputScope attribute, when set to Topic the message deduplication scope is across the entire topic, when set to MessageGroup the message deduplication scope is within each individual message group.   If a message with a particular MessageDeduplicationId is sent successfully, subsequent messages within the deduplication scope and interval, with the same MessageDeduplicationId, are accepted successfully but aren't delivered.   Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId:   You may provide a MessageDeduplicationId explicitly.   If you aren't able to provide a MessageDeduplicationId and you enable ContentBasedDeduplication for your topic, Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).   If you don't provide a MessageDeduplicationId and the topic doesn't have ContentBasedDeduplication set, the action fails with an error.   If the topic has a ContentBasedDeduplication set, your MessageDeduplicationId overrides the generated one.      When ContentBasedDeduplication is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication scope and interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.   If you send one message with ContentBasedDeduplication enabled, and then another message with a MessageDeduplicationId that is the same as the one generated for the first MessageDeduplicationId, the two messages are treated as duplicates, within the deduplication scope and interval, and only one copy of the message is delivered.
    ///   - messageGroupId: This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) topics. The MessageGroupId can contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;?@[\]^_`{|}~). The MessageGroupId is a tag that specifies that a message belongs to a specific message group. Messages that belong to the same message group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different message groups might be processed out of order). Every message must include a MessageGroupId.
    ///   - messageStructure: Set MessageStructure to json if you want to send a different message for each protocol. For example, using one publish action, you can send a short message to your SMS subscribers and a longer message to your email subscribers. If you set MessageStructure to json, the value of the Message parameter must:    be a syntactically valid JSON object; and   contain at least a top-level JSON key of "default" with a value that is a string.   You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want to send to a specific transport protocol (e.g., "http"). Valid value: json
    ///   - phoneNumber: The phone number to which you want to deliver an SMS message. Use E.164 format. If you don't specify a value for the PhoneNumber parameter, you must specify a value for the TargetArn or TopicArn parameters.

Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of 200. The maximum allowed individual message size and the maximum total payload size (the sum of the individual lengths of all of the batched messages) are both 256 KB (262,144 bytes).  Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the param.n notation. Values of n are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:  &AttributeName.1=first &AttributeName.2=second If you send a batch message to a topic, Amazon SNS publishes the batch message to each endpoint that is subscribed to the topic. The format of the batch message depends on the notification protocol for each subscribed endpoint. When a messageId is returned, the batch message is saved and Amazon SNS immediately delivers the message to subscribers.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - attributes: The default settings for sending SMS messages from your Amazon Web Services account. You can set values for the following attribute names:  MonthlySpendLimit – The maximum amount in USD that you are willing to spend each month to send SMS messages. When Amazon SNS determines that sending an SMS message would incur a cost that exceeds this limit, it stops sending SMS messages within minutes.  Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes of the limit being crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS messages, you will incur costs that exceed your limit.  By default, the spend limit is set to the maximum allowed by Amazon SNS. If you want to raise the limit, submit an SNS Limit Increase case. For New limit value, enter your desired monthly spend limit. In the Use Case Description field, explain that you are requesting an SMS monthly spend limit increase.  DeliveryStatusIAMRole – The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon SNS to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure (if the message failed), the message dwell time, and other information.  DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate – The percentage of successful SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs. The value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For example, to write logs only for failed deliveries, set this value to 0. To write logs for 10% of your successful deliveries, set it to 10.  DefaultSenderID – A string, such as your business brand, that is displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for sender IDs varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric characters, and it must contain at least one letter.  DefaultSMSType – The type of SMS message that you will send by default. You can assign the following values:    Promotional – (Default) Noncritical messages, such as marketing messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to incur the lowest cost.    Transactional – Critical messages that support customer transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to achieve the highest reliability.    UsageReportS3Bucket – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS will deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report includes the following information for each SMS message that was successfully delivered by your Amazon Web Services account:   Time that the message was published (in UTC)   Message ID   Destination phone number   Message type   Delivery status   Message price (in USD)   Part number (a message is split into multiple parts if it is too long for a single message)   Total number of parts   To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the Amazon SNS service principal to perform the s3:PutObject and s3:GetBucketLocation actions. For an example bucket policy and usage report, see Monitoring SMS Activity in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.

DeliveryPolicy – The policy that defines how Amazon SNS retries failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.    DisplayName – The display name to use for a topic with SMS subscriptions.    Policy – The policy that defines who can access your topic. By default, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.    TracingConfig – Tracing mode of an Amazon SNS topic. By default TracingConfig is set to PassThrough, and the topic passes through the tracing header it receives from an Amazon SNS publisher to its subscriptions. If set to Active, Amazon SNS will vend X-Ray segment data to topic owner account if the sampled flag in the tracing header is true. This is only supported on standard topics.   HTTP    HTTPSuccessFeedbackRoleArn – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP endpoint.     HTTPSuccessFeedbackSampleRate – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP endpoint.    HTTPFailureFeedbackRoleArn – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an HTTP endpoint.     Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose    FirehoseSuccessFeedbackRoleArn – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose endpoint.    FirehoseSuccessFeedbackSampleRate – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose endpoint.    FirehoseFailureFeedbackRoleArn – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose endpoint.      Lambda    LambdaSuccessFeedbackRoleArn – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda endpoint.    LambdaSuccessFeedbackSampleRate – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda endpoint.    LambdaFailureFeedbackRoleArn – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Lambda endpoint.      Platform application endpoint    ApplicationSuccessFeedbackRoleArn – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Web Services application endpoint.    ApplicationSuccessFeedbackSampleRate – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Web Services application endpoint.    ApplicationFailureFeedbackRoleArn – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon Web Services application endpoint.    In addition to being able to configure topic attributes for message delivery status of notification messages sent to Amazon SNS application endpoints, you can also configure application attributes for the delivery status of push notification messages sent to push notification services. For example, For more information, see Using Amazon SNS Application Attributes for Message Delivery Status.     Amazon SQS    SQSSuccessFeedbackRoleArn – Indicates successful message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS endpoint.     SQSSuccessFeedbackSampleRate – Indicates percentage of successful messages to sample for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS endpoint.     SQSFailureFeedbackRoleArn – Indicates failed message delivery status for an Amazon SNS topic that is subscribed to an Amazon SQS endpoint.       The SuccessFeedbackRoleArn and FailureFeedbackRoleArn attributes are used to give Amazon SNS write access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf. The SuccessFeedbackSampleRate attribute is for specifying the sample rate percentage (0-100) of successfully delivered messages. After you configure the FailureFeedbackRoleArn attribute, then all failed message deliveries generate CloudWatch Logs.   The following attribute applies only to server-side-encryption:    KmsMasterKeyId – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms. For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Management Service API Reference.     SignatureVersion – The signature version corresponds to the hashing algorithm used while creating the signature of the notifications, subscription confirmations, or unsubscribe confirmation messages sent by Amazon SNS. By default, SignatureVersion is set to 1.   The following attribute applies only to FIFO topics:    ArchivePolicy – The policy that sets the retention period for messages stored in the message archive of an Amazon SNS FIFO topic.    ContentBasedDeduplication – Enables content-based deduplication for FIFO topics.   By default, ContentBasedDeduplication is set to false. If you create a FIFO topic and this attribute is false, you must specify a value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the Publish action.    When you set ContentBasedDeduplication to true, Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message). (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the Publish action.        FifoThroughputScope – Enables higher throughput for your FIFO topic by adjusting the scope of deduplication. This attribute has two possible values:    Topic – The scope of message deduplication is across the entire topic. This is the default value and maintains existing behavior, with a maximum throughput of 3000 messages per second or 20MB per second, whichever comes first.    MessageGroup – The scope of deduplication is within each individual message group, which enables higher throughput per topic subject to regional quotas. For more information on quotas or to request an increase, see Amazon SNS service quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

This eliminates the need for the endpoints to process JSON formatting, which is otherwise created for Amazon SNS metadata.    RedrivePolicy – When specified, sends undeliverable messages to the specified Amazon SQS dead-letter queue.  Messages that can't be delivered due to client errors (for example, when the subscribed endpoint is unreachable) or server errors (for example, when the service that powers the subscribed endpoint becomes unavailable) are held  in the dead-letter queue for further analysis or reprocessing.   The following attribute applies only to Amazon Data Firehose delivery stream subscriptions:    SubscriptionRoleArn – The ARN of the IAM role that has the following:   Permission to write to the Firehose delivery stream   Amazon SNS listed as a trusted entity   Specifying a valid ARN for this attribute is required for Firehose delivery stream subscriptions.  For more information, see Fanout  to Firehose delivery streams in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.   The following attributes apply only to FIFO topics:    ReplayPolicy – Adds or updates an inline policy document for a subscription to replay messages stored in the specified Amazon SNS topic.    ReplayStatus – Retrieves the status of the subscription message replay, which can be one of the following:    Completed – The replay has successfully redelivered all messages, and is now delivering newly published messages. If an ending point was specified in the ReplayPolicy then the subscription will no longer receive newly published messages.    In progress – The replay is currently replaying the selected messages.    Failed – The replay was unable to complete.    Pending – The default state while the replay initiates.
    ///   - endpoint: The endpoint that you want to receive notifications. Endpoints vary by protocol:   For the http protocol, the (public) endpoint is a URL beginning with http://.   For the https protocol, the (public) endpoint is a URL beginning with https://.   For the email protocol, the endpoint is an email address.   For the email-json protocol, the endpoint is an email address.   For the sms protocol, the endpoint is a phone number of an SMS-enabled device.   For the sqs protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an Amazon SQS queue.   For the application protocol, the endpoint is the EndpointArn of a mobile app and device.   For the lambda protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an Lambda function.   For the firehose protocol, the endpoint is the ARN of an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.
    ///   - protocol: The protocol that you want to use. Supported protocols include:    http – delivery of JSON-encoded message via HTTP POST    https – delivery of JSON-encoded message via HTTPS POST    email – delivery of message via SMTP    email-json – delivery of JSON-encoded message via SMTP    sms – delivery of message via SMS    sqs – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Amazon SQS queue    application – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an EndpointArn for a mobile app and device    lambda – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Lambda function    firehose – delivery of JSON-encoded message to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.
