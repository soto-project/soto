/// Amazon Simple Notification Service Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see the Amazon SNS product page. For detailed information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API calls, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.  For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see Identity and access management in Amazon SNS in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.  We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses. For a list of available SDKs, go to Tools for Amazon Web Services.

PlatformPrincipal and PlatformCredential are received from the notification service.   For ADM, PlatformPrincipal is client id and PlatformCredential is client secret.   For Baidu, PlatformPrincipal is API key and PlatformCredential is secret key.   For APNS and APNS_SANDBOX using certificate credentials, PlatformPrincipal is SSL certificate and PlatformCredential is private key.   For APNS and APNS_SANDBOX using token credentials, PlatformPrincipal is signing key ID and PlatformCredential is signing key.   For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) using key credentials, there is no PlatformPrincipal. The PlatformCredential is API key.   For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) using token credentials, there is no PlatformPrincipal. The PlatformCredential is a JSON formatted private key file. When using the Amazon Web Services CLI, the file must be in string format and special characters must be ignored. To format the file correctly, Amazon SNS recommends using the following command: SERVICE_JSON=`jq @json .   For MPNS, PlatformPrincipal is TLS certificate and PlatformCredential is private key.   For WNS, PlatformPrincipal is Package Security Identifier and PlatformCredential is secret key.
