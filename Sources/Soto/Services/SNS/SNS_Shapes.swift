SubscriptionsDeleted – The number of deleted subscriptions for the topic.    SubscriptionsPending – The number of subscriptions pending confirmation for the topic.    TopicArn – The topic's ARN.    EffectiveDeliveryPolicy – The JSON serialization of the effective delivery policy, taking system defaults into account.    The following attribute applies only to server-side-encryption:    KmsMasterKeyId - The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms. For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Management Service API Reference.     The following attributes apply only to FIFO topics:    FifoTopic – When this is set to true, a FIFO topic is created.    ContentBasedDeduplication – Enables content-based deduplication for FIFO topics.    By default, ContentBasedDeduplication is set to false. If you create a FIFO topic and this attribute is false, you must specify a value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the Publish action.    When you set ContentBasedDeduplication to true,  Amazon SNS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using  the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message). (Optional) To override the generated value, you can specify a value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the Publish action.

If you want to send different messages for each transport protocol, set the value of the MessageStructure parameter to json and use a JSON object for the Message parameter.    Constraints:   With the exception of SMS, messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings and at most 256 KB in size (262,144 bytes, not 262,144 characters).   For SMS, each message can contain up to 140 characters. This character limit depends on the encoding schema. For example, an SMS message can contain 160 GSM characters, 140 ASCII characters, or 70 UCS-2 characters. If you publish a message that exceeds this size limit, Amazon SNS sends the message as multiple messages, each fitting within the size limit. Messages aren't truncated mid-word but are cut off at whole-word boundaries. The total size limit for a single SMS Publish action is 1,600 characters.   JSON-specific constraints:   Keys in the JSON object that correspond to supported transport protocols must have simple JSON string values.   The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in outgoing messages.   Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the characters will be reescaped for sending).   Values have a minimum length of 0 (the empty string, "", is allowed).   Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall message size (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes).   Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored.   Keys that do not correspond to supported transport protocols are ignored.   Duplicate keys are not allowed.   Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message will cause the Publish call to return an error (no partial delivery).

If a message with a particular MessageDeduplicationId is sent successfully, any message sent with the same MessageDeduplicationId during the 5-minute deduplication interval is treated as a duplicate.

You can set values for the following attribute names:  MonthlySpendLimit – The maximum amount in USD that you are willing to spend each month to send SMS messages. When Amazon SNS determines that sending an SMS message would incur a cost that exceeds this limit, it stops sending SMS messages within minutes.  Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes of the limit being crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS messages, you will incur costs that exceed your limit.  By default, the spend limit is set to the maximum allowed by Amazon SNS. If you want to raise the limit, submit an SNS Limit Increase case. For New limit value, enter your desired monthly spend limit. In the Use Case Description field, explain that you are requesting an SMS monthly spend limit increase.  DeliveryStatusIAMRole – The ARN of the IAM role that allows Amazon SNS to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure (if the message failed), the message dwell time, and other information.  DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate – The percentage of successful SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs. The value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For example, to write logs only for failed deliveries, set this value to 0. To write logs for 10% of your successful deliveries, set it to 10.  DefaultSenderID – A string, such as your business brand, that is displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for sender IDs varies by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric characters, and it must contain at least one letter.  DefaultSMSType – The type of SMS message that you will send by default. You can assign the following values:    Promotional – (Default) Noncritical messages, such as marketing messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to incur the lowest cost.    Transactional – Critical messages that support customer transactions, such as one-time passcodes for multi-factor authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to achieve the highest reliability.    UsageReportS3Bucket – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS will deliver a usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report includes the following information for each SMS message that was successfully delivered by your account:   Time that the message was published (in UTC)   Message ID   Destination phone number   Message type   Delivery status   Message price (in USD)   Part number (a message is split into multiple parts if it is too long for a single message)   Total number of parts   To receive the report, the bucket must have a policy that allows the Amazon SNS service principal to perform the s3:PutObject and s3:GetBucketLocation actions. For an example bucket policy and usage report, see Monitoring SMS Activity in the Amazon SNS Developer Guide.
