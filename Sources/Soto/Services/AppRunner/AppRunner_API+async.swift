For each mapped domain name, add a mapping to the target App Runner subdomain and one or more certificate validation records. App Runner then performs DNS validation to verify that you own or control the domain name that you associated. App Runner tracks domain validity in a certificate stored in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

When you create a service, you can set it to use the latest active revision of an auto scaling configuration or a specific revision.
