/// Service object for interacting with AWS AppRunner service.
///
/// AWS App Runner AWS App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container image or source code to a running service in the AWS cloud in seconds. You don't need to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how to provision and configure AWS resources. App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully managed operations, high performance, scalability, and security. For more information about App Runner, see the AWS App Runner Developer Guide. For release information, see the AWS App Runner Release Notes.  To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use to access the API, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  Endpoints  For a list of Region-specific endpoints that App Runner supports, see AWS App Runner endpoints and quotas in the AWS General Reference.

    /// Associate your own domain name with the AWS App Runner subdomain URL of your App Runner service. After you call AssociateCustomDomain and receive a successful response, use the information in the CustomDomain record that's returned to add CNAME records to your Domain Name System (DNS). For each mapped domain name, add a mapping to the target App Runner subdomain and one or more certificate validation records. App Runner then performs DNS validation to verify that you own or control the domain name that you associated. App Runner tracks domain validity in a certificate stored in AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

Create multiple revisions of a configuration by using the same AutoScalingConfigurationName and different AutoScalingConfigurationRevision values. When you create a service, you can set it to use the latest active revision of an auto scaling configuration or a specific revision.

Configure a lower MaxSize to control your cost. The tradeoff is lower responsiveness during peak demand.
