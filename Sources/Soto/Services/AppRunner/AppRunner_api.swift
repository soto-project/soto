/// Service object for interacting with AWS AppRunner service.
///
/// App Runner App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container image or source code to a running service in the Amazon Web Services Cloud in seconds. You don't need to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how to provision and configure Amazon Web Services resources. App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully managed operations, high performance, scalability, and security. For more information about App Runner, see the App Runner Developer Guide. For release information, see the App Runner Release Notes.  To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use to access the API, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  Endpoints  For a list of Region-specific endpoints that App Runner supports, see App Runner endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

    ///   - autoScalingConfigurationName: A name for the auto scaling configuration. When you use it for the first time in an Amazon Web Services Region, App Runner creates revision number 1 of this name. When you use the same name in subsequent calls, App Runner creates incremental revisions of the configuration.  Prior to the release of Auto scale configuration enhancements, the name DefaultConfiguration was reserved.  This restriction is no longer in place. You can now manage DefaultConfiguration the same way you manage your custom auto scaling configurations. This means you can do the following with the DefaultConfiguration that App Runner provides:   Create new revisions of the DefaultConfiguration.   Delete the revisions of the DefaultConfiguration.   Delete the auto scaling configuration for which the App Runner DefaultConfiguration was created.   If you delete the auto scaling configuration you can create another custom auto scaling configuration with the same DefaultConfiguration name. The original DefaultConfiguration resource provided by App Runner remains in your account unless you make changes to it.
    ///   - maxConcurrency: The maximum number of concurrent requests that you want an instance to process. If the number of concurrent requests exceeds this limit, App Runner scales up your service. Default: 100
    ///   - maxSize: The maximum number of instances that your service scales up to. At most MaxSize instances actively serve traffic for your service. Default: 25
    ///   - minSize: The minimum number of instances that App Runner provisions for your service. The service always has at least MinSize provisioned instances. Some of them actively serve traffic. The rest of them (provisioned and inactive instances) are a cost-effective compute capacity reserve and are ready to be quickly activated. You pay for memory usage of all the provisioned instances. You pay for CPU usage of only the active subset. App Runner temporarily doubles the number of provisioned instances during deployments, to maintain the same capacity for both old and new code.
