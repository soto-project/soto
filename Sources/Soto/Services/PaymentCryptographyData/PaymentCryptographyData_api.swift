/// You use the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane to manage how encryption keys are used for payment-related transaction processing and associated cryptographic operations. You can encrypt, decrypt, generate, verify, and translate payment-related cryptographic operations in Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. For more information, see Data operations in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. To manage your encryption keys, you use the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane. You can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can also manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys.

    /// Decrypts ciphertext data to plaintext using a symmetric (TDES, AES), asymmetric (RSA), or derived (DUKPT or EMV) encryption key scheme. For more information, see Decrypt data in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. You can use an decryption key generated within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, or you can import your own decryption key by calling ImportKey. For this operation, the key must have KeyModesOfUse set to Decrypt. In asymmetric decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography decrypts the ciphertext using the private component of the asymmetric encryption key pair. For data encryption outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, you can export the public component of the asymmetric key pair by calling GetPublicCertificate. This operation also supports dynamic keys, allowing you to pass a dynamic decryption key as a TR-31 WrappedKeyBlock. This can be used when key material is frequently rotated, such as during every card transaction, and there is need to avoid importing short-lived keys into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. To decrypt using dynamic keys, the keyARN is the Key Encryption Key (KEK) of the TR-31 wrapped decryption key material. The incoming wrapped key shall have a key purpose of D0 with a mode of use of B or D. For more information, see Using Dynamic Keys in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. For symmetric and DUKPT decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports TDES and AES algorithms. For EMV decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports TDES algorithms. For asymmetric decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports RSA.  When you use TDES or TDES DUKPT, the ciphertext data length must be a multiple of 8 bytes. For AES or AES DUKPT, the ciphertext data length must be a multiple of 16 bytes. For RSA, it sould be equal to the key size unless padding is enabled. For information about valid keys for this operation, see Understanding key attributes and Key types for specific data operations in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.

PIN block translation occurs entirely within the HSM boundary and PIN data never enters or leaves Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography in clear text.

For more information on establishing ECDH derived keys, see the Generating keys in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.

It is important to note that not all encrypted PIN block formats (example, format 1) require PAN (Primary Account Number) as input.
