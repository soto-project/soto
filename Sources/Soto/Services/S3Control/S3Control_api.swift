Using PutBucketReplication on Outposts requires that both the source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled. For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see Managing S3 Versioning for your S3 on Outposts bucket. For information about S3 on Outposts replication failure reasons, see Replication failure reasons in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects  Outposts buckets are encrypted at all times. All the objects in the source Outposts bucket are encrypted and can be replicated. Also, all the replicas in the destination Outposts bucket are encrypted with the same encryption key as the objects in the source Outposts bucket.  Permissions  To create a PutBucketReplication request, you must have s3-outposts:PutReplicationConfiguration permissions for the bucket. The Outposts bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant it to others. For more information about permissions, see Setting up IAM with S3 on Outposts and Managing access to S3 on Outposts buckets.   To perform this operation, the user or role must also have the iam:CreateRole and iam:PassRole permissions. For more information, see Granting a user permissions to pass a role to an Amazon Web Services service.  All Amazon S3 on Outposts REST API requests for this action require an additional parameter of x-amz-outpost-id to be passed with the request. In addition, you must use an S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix instead of s3-control. For an example of the request syntax for Amazon S3 on Outposts that uses the S3 on Outposts endpoint hostname prefix and the x-amz-outpost-id derived by using the access point ARN, see the Examples section. The following operations are related to PutBucketReplication:    GetBucketReplication     DeleteBucketReplication
    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - accountId: The Amazon Web Services account ID of the Outposts bucket.
    ///   - bucket: Specifies the S3 on Outposts bucket to set the configuration for. For using this parameter with Amazon S3 on Outposts with the REST API, you must specify the name and the x-amz-outpost-id as well. For using this parameter with S3 on Outposts with the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, you must  specify the ARN of the bucket accessed in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:::outpost//bucket/. For example, to access the bucket reports through Outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/bucket/reports.
