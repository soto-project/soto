/// Service object for interacting with AWS TimestreamWrite service.
///
/// Amazon Timestream Write Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time-series database service that makes it easy to store and analyze trillions of time-series data points per day. With Timestream, you can easily store and analyze IoT sensor data to derive insights from your IoT applications. You can analyze industrial telemetry to streamline equipment management and maintenance. You can also store and analyze log data and metrics to improve the performance and availability of your applications.  Timestream is built from the ground up to effectively ingest, process, and store time-series data. It organizes data to optimize query processing. It automatically scales based on the volume of data ingested and on the query volume to ensure you receive optimal performance while inserting and querying data. As your data grows over time, Timestream’s adaptive query processing engine spans across storage tiers to provide fast analysis while reducing costs.

    /// Enables you to write your time-series data into Timestream. You can specify a single data point or a batch of data points to be inserted into the system. Timestream offers you a flexible schema that auto detects the column names and data types for your Timestream tables based on the dimension names and data types of the data points you specify when invoking writes into the database.  Timestream supports eventual consistency read semantics. This means that when you query data immediately after writing a batch of data into Timestream, the query results might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The results may also include some stale data. If you repeat the query request after a short time, the results should return the latest data. Service quotas apply.  See code sample for details.  Upserts  You can use the Version parameter in a WriteRecords request to update data points. Timestream tracks a version number with each record. Version defaults to 1 when it's not specified for the record in the request. Timestream updates an existing record’s measure value along with its Version when it receives a write request with a higher Version number for that record. When it receives an update request where the measure value is the same as that of the existing record, Timestream still updates Version, if it is greater than the existing value of Version. You can update a data point as many times as desired, as long as the value of Version continuously increases.  For example, suppose you write a new record without indicating Version in the request. Timestream stores this record, and set Version to 1. Now, suppose you try to update this record with a WriteRecords request of the same record with a different measure value but, like before, do not provide Version. In this case, Timestream will reject this update with a RejectedRecordsException since the updated record’s version is not greater than the existing value of Version.  However, if you were to resend the update request with Version set to 2, Timestream would then succeed in updating the record’s value, and the Version would be set to 2. Next, suppose you sent a WriteRecords request with this same record and an identical measure value, but with Version set to 3. In this case, Timestream would only update Version to 3. Any further updates would need to send a version number greater than 3, or the update requests would receive a RejectedRecordsException.
