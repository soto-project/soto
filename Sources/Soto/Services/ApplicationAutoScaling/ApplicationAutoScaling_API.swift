/// Service object for interacting with AWS ApplicationAutoScaling service.
///
/// With Application Auto Scaling, you can configure automatic scaling for the following resources:   Amazon AppStream 2.0 fleets   Amazon Aurora Replicas   Amazon Comprehend document classification and entity recognizer endpoints   Amazon DynamoDB tables and global secondary indexes throughput capacity   Amazon ECS services   Amazon ElastiCache for Redis clusters (replication groups)   Amazon EMR clusters   Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) tables   Lambda function provisioned concurrency   Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka broker storage   Amazon SageMaker endpoint variants   Spot Fleet (Amazon EC2) requests   Custom resources provided by your own applications or services    API Summary  The Application Auto Scaling service API includes three key sets of actions:    Register and manage scalable targets - Register Amazon Web Services or custom resources as scalable targets (a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale), set minimum and maximum capacity limits, and retrieve information on existing scalable targets.   Configure and manage automatic scaling - Define scaling policies to dynamically scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms, schedule one-time or recurring scaling actions, and retrieve your recent scaling activity history.   Suspend and resume scaling - Temporarily suspend and later resume automatic scaling by calling the RegisterScalableTarget API action for any Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can suspend and resume (individually or in combination) scale-out activities that are triggered by a scaling policy, scale-in activities that are triggered by a scaling policy, and scheduled scaling.

    /// Creates or updates a scaling policy for an Application Auto Scaling scalable target. Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID, and scalable dimension. A scaling policy applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scaling policy until you have registered the resource as a scalable target. Multiple scaling policies can be in force at the same time for the same scalable target. You can have one or more target tracking scaling policies, one or more step scaling policies, or both. However, there is a chance that multiple policies could conflict, instructing the scalable target to scale out or in at the same time. Application Auto Scaling gives precedence to the policy that provides the largest capacity for both scale out and scale in. For example, if one policy increases capacity by 3, another policy increases capacity by 200 percent, and the current capacity is 10, Application Auto Scaling uses the policy with the highest calculated capacity (200% of 10 = 20) and scales out to 30.  We recommend caution, however, when using target tracking scaling policies with step scaling policies because conflicts between these policies can cause undesirable behavior. For example, if the step scaling policy initiates a scale-in activity before the target tracking policy is ready to scale in, the scale-in activity will not be blocked. After the scale-in activity completes, the target tracking policy could instruct the scalable target to scale out again.  For more information, see Target tracking scaling policies and Step scaling policies in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.  If a scalable target is deregistered, the scalable target is no longer available to execute scaling policies. Any scaling policies that were specified for the scalable target are deleted.

A scheduled action applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scheduled action until you have registered the resource as a scalable target. When start and end times are specified with a recurring schedule using a cron expression or rates, they form the boundaries for when the recurring action starts and stops. To update a scheduled action, specify the parameters that you want to change. If you don't specify start and end times, the old values are deleted. For more information, see Scheduled scaling in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.  If a scalable target is deregistered, the scalable target is no longer available to run scheduled actions.

Scalable targets are uniquely identified by the combination of resource ID, scalable dimension, and namespace.  When you register a new scalable target, you must specify values for minimum and maximum capacity. Current capacity will be adjusted within the specified range when scaling starts. Application Auto Scaling scaling policies will not scale capacity to values that are outside of this range. After you register a scalable target, you do not need to register it again to use other Application Auto Scaling operations. To see which resources have been registered, use DescribeScalableTargets. You can also view the scaling policies for a service namespace by using DescribeScalableTargets. If you no longer need a scalable target, you can deregister it by using DeregisterScalableTarget. To update a scalable target, specify the parameters that you want to change. Include the parameters that identify the scalable target: resource ID, scalable dimension, and namespace.
