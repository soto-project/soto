/// Service object for interacting with AWS ApplicationAutoScaling service.
///
/// With Application Auto Scaling, you can configure automatic scaling for the following resources:   Amazon AppStream 2.0 fleets   Amazon Aurora Replicas   Amazon Comprehend document classification and entity recognizer endpoints   Amazon DynamoDB tables and global secondary indexes throughput capacity   Amazon ECS services   Amazon ElastiCache replication groups (Redis OSS and Valkey) and Memcached clusters   Amazon EMR clusters   Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) tables   Lambda function provisioned concurrency   Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka broker storage   Amazon Neptune clusters   Amazon SageMaker endpoint variants   Amazon SageMaker inference components   Amazon SageMaker serverless endpoint provisioned concurrency   Spot Fleets (Amazon EC2)   Pool of WorkSpaces   Custom resources provided by your own applications or services   To learn more about Application Auto Scaling, see the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.  API Summary  The Application Auto Scaling service API includes three key sets of actions:    Register and manage scalable targets - Register Amazon Web Services or custom resources as scalable targets (a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale), set minimum and maximum capacity limits, and retrieve information on existing scalable targets.   Configure and manage automatic scaling - Define scaling policies to dynamically scale your resources in response to CloudWatch alarms, schedule one-time or recurring scaling actions, and retrieve your recent scaling activity history.   Suspend and resume scaling - Temporarily suspend and later resume automatic scaling by calling the RegisterScalableTarget API action for any Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can suspend and resume (individually or in combination) scale-out activities that are triggered by a scaling policy, scale-in activities that are triggered by a scaling policy, and scheduled scaling.

    /// Creates or updates a scaling policy for an Application Auto Scaling scalable target. Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID, and scalable dimension. A scaling policy applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scaling policy until you have registered the resource as a scalable target. Multiple scaling policies can be in force at the same time for the same scalable target. You can have one or more target tracking scaling policies, one or more step scaling policies, or both. However, there is a chance that multiple policies could conflict, instructing the scalable target to scale out or in at the same time. Application Auto Scaling gives precedence to the policy that provides the largest capacity for both scale out and scale in. For example, if one policy increases capacity by 3, another policy increases capacity by 200 percent, and the current capacity is 10, Application Auto Scaling uses the policy with the highest calculated capacity (200% of 10 = 20) and scales out to 30.  We recommend caution, however, when using target tracking scaling policies with step scaling policies because conflicts between these policies can cause undesirable behavior. For example, if the step scaling policy initiates a scale-in activity before the target tracking policy is ready to scale in, the scale-in activity will not be blocked. After the scale-in activity completes, the target tracking policy could instruct the scalable target to scale out again.  For more information, see Target tracking scaling policies, Step scaling policies, and Predictive scaling policies  in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.

To update a scheduled action, specify the parameters that you want to change. If you don't specify start and end times, the old values are deleted. For more information, see Scheduled scaling in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide.  If a scalable target is deregistered, the scalable target is no longer available to run scheduled actions. Any scheduled actions that were specified for the scalable target are deleted.

Scalable targets are uniquely identified by the combination of resource ID, scalable dimension, and namespace, which represents some capacity dimension of the underlying service. When you register a new scalable target, you must specify values for the minimum and maximum capacity. If the specified resource is not active in the target service, this operation does not change the resource's current capacity.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - maxCapacity: The maximum value that you plan to scale out to. When a scaling policy is in effect, Application Auto Scaling can scale out (expand) as needed to the maximum capacity limit in response to changing demand. This property is required when registering a new scalable target. Although you can specify a large maximum capacity, note that service quotas might impose lower limits. Each service has its own default quotas for the maximum capacity of the resource. If you want to specify a higher limit, you can request an increase. For more information, consult the documentation for that service. For information about the default quotas for each service, see Service endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
    ///   - minCapacity: The minimum value that you plan to scale in to. When a scaling policy is in effect, Application Auto Scaling can scale in (contract) as needed to the minimum capacity limit in response to changing demand.

AppStream 2.0 fleets   Aurora DB clusters   ECS services   EMR clusters   Lambda provisioned concurrency   SageMaker endpoint variants   SageMaker inference components   SageMaker serverless endpoint provisioned concurrency   Spot Fleets   custom resources   It's strongly recommended that you specify a value greater than 0. A value greater than 0 means that data points are continuously reported to CloudWatch that scaling policies can use to scale on a metric like average CPU utilization. For all other resources, the minimum allowed value depends on the type of resource that you are using. If you provide a value that is lower than what a resource can accept, an error occurs. In which case, the error message will provide the minimum value that the resource can accept.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - maxResults: The maximum number of scheduled action results. This value can be between 1 and 50. The default value is 50. If this parameter is used, the operation returns up to MaxResults results at a time, along with a NextToken value. To get the next set of results, include the NextToken value in a subsequent call. If this parameter is not used, the operation returns up to 50 results and a NextToken value, if applicable.
    ///   - resourceId: The identifier of the resource associated with the scheduled action. This string consists of the resource type and unique identifier.   ECS service - The resource type is service and the unique identifier is the cluster name   and service name. Example: service/my-cluster/my-service.
