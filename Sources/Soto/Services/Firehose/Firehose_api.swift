    // MARK: API Calls

    /// Creates a Firehose stream. By default, you can create up to 50 Firehose streams per Amazon Web Services Region. This is an asynchronous operation that immediately returns. The initial status of the Firehose stream is CREATING. After the Firehose stream is created, its status is ACTIVE and it now accepts data. If the Firehose stream creation fails, the status transitions to CREATING_FAILED. Attempts to send data to a delivery stream that is not in the ACTIVE state cause an exception. To check the state of a Firehose stream, use DescribeDeliveryStream. If the status of a Firehose stream is CREATING_FAILED, this status doesn't change, and you can't invoke CreateDeliveryStream again on it. However, you can invoke the DeleteDeliveryStream operation to delete it. A Firehose stream can be configured to receive records directly from providers using PutRecord or PutRecordBatch, or it can be configured to use an existing Kinesis stream as its source. To specify a Kinesis data stream as input, set the DeliveryStreamType parameter to KinesisStreamAsSource, and provide the Kinesis stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and role ARN in the KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration parameter. To create a Firehose stream with server-side encryption (SSE) enabled, include DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput in your request. This is optional. You can also invoke StartDeliveryStreamEncryption to turn on SSE for an existing Firehose stream that doesn't have SSE enabled. A Firehose stream is configured with a single destination, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, Splunk, and any custom HTTP endpoint or HTTP endpoints owned by or supported by third-party service providers, including Datadog, Dynatrace, LogicMonitor, MongoDB, New Relic, and Sumo Logic. You must specify only one of the following destination configuration parameters: ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration, S3DestinationConfiguration, ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration, RedshiftDestinationConfiguration, or SplunkDestinationConfiguration. When you specify S3DestinationConfiguration, you can also provide the following optional values: BufferingHints, EncryptionConfiguration, and CompressionFormat. By default, if no BufferingHints value is provided, Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever condition is satisfied first. BufferingHints is a hint, so there are some cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly. For example, record boundaries might be such that the size is a little over or under the configured buffering size. By default, no encryption is performed. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption to ensure secure data storage in Amazon S3. A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a destination:   An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location. Firehose first delivers data to Amazon S3 and then uses COPY syntax to load data into an Amazon Redshift table. This is specified in the RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration parameter.   The compression formats SNAPPY or ZIP cannot be specified in RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration because the Amazon Redshift COPY operation that reads from the S3 bucket doesn't support these compression formats.   We strongly recommend that you use the user name and password you provide exclusively with Firehose, and that the permissions for the account are restricted for Amazon Redshift INSERT permissions.   Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part of the destination. The role should allow the Firehose principal to assume the role, and the role should have permissions that allow the service to deliver the data. For more information, see Grant Firehose Access to an Amazon S3 Destination in the Amazon Firehose Developer Guide.

For more information about tags, see Using Cost Allocation Tags in the Amazon Web Services Billing and Cost Management User Guide. You can specify up to 50 tags when creating a Firehose stream. If you specify tags in the CreateDeliveryStream action, Amazon Data Firehose performs an additional authorization on the firehose:TagDeliveryStream action to verify if users have permissions to create tags. If you do not provide this permission, requests to create new Firehose streams with IAM resource tags will fail with an AccessDeniedException such as following.  AccessDeniedException  User: arn:aws:sts::x:assumed-role/x/x is not authorized to perform: firehose:TagDeliveryStream on resource: arn:aws:firehose:us-east-1:x:deliverystream/x with an explicit deny in an identity-based policy. For an example IAM policy, see Tag example.

If you use PutRecord and PutRecordBatch, the limits are an aggregate across these two operations for each Firehose stream. For more information about limits and how to request an increase, see Amazon Firehose Limits.  Firehose accumulates and publishes a particular metric for a customer account in one minute intervals. It is possible that the bursts of incoming bytes/records ingested to a Firehose stream last only for a few seconds. Due to this, the actual spikes in the traffic might not be fully visible in the customer's 1 minute CloudWatch metrics. You must specify the name of the Firehose stream and the data record when using PutRecord. The data record consists of a data blob that can be up to 1,000 KiB in size, and any kind of data. For example, it can be a segment from a log file, geographic location data, website clickstream data, and so on. For multi record de-aggregation, you can not put more than 500 records even if the data blob length is less than 1000 KiB. If you include more than 500 records, the request succeeds but the record de-aggregation doesn't work as expected and transformation lambda is invoked with the complete base64 encoded data blob instead of de-aggregated base64 decoded records. Firehose buffers records before delivering them to the destination. To disambiguate the data blobs at the destination, a common solution is to use delimiters in the data, such as a newline (\n) or some other character unique within the data. This allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the data from the destination. The PutRecord operation returns a RecordId, which is a unique string assigned to each record. Producer applications can use this ID for purposes such as auditability and investigation. If the PutRecord operation throws a ServiceUnavailableException, the API is automatically reinvoked (retried) 3 times. If the exception persists, it is possible that the throughput limits have been exceeded for the Firehose stream.  Re-invoking the Put API operations (for example, PutRecord and PutRecordBatch) can result in data duplicates. For larger data assets, allow for a longer time out before retrying Put API operations. Data records sent to Firehose are stored for 24 hours from the time they are added to a Firehose stream as it tries to send the records to the destination. If the destination is unreachable for more than 24 hours, the data is no longer available.  Don't concatenate two or more base64 strings to form the data fields of your records.

This allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the data from the destination. The PutRecordBatch response includes a count of failed records, FailedPutCount, and an array of responses, RequestResponses. Even if the PutRecordBatch call succeeds, the value of FailedPutCount may be greater than 0, indicating that there are records for which the operation didn't succeed. Each entry in the RequestResponses array provides additional information about the processed record. It directly correlates with a record in the request array using the same ordering, from the top to the bottom. The response array always includes the same number of records as the request array. RequestResponses includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Firehose tries to process all records in each PutRecordBatch request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records.  A successfully processed record includes a RecordId value, which is unique for the record. An unsuccessfully processed record includes ErrorCode and ErrorMessage values. ErrorCode reflects the type of error, and is one of the following values: ServiceUnavailableException or InternalFailure. ErrorMessage provides more detailed information about the error. If there is an internal server error or a timeout, the write might have completed or it might have failed. If FailedPutCount is greater than 0, retry the request, resending only those records that might have failed processing. This minimizes the possible duplicate records and also reduces the total bytes sent (and corresponding charges). We recommend that you handle any duplicates at the destination.

To check the encryption state of a Firehose stream, use DescribeDeliveryStream.  If SSE is enabled using a customer managed CMK and then you invoke StopDeliveryStreamEncryption, Firehose schedules the related KMS grant for retirement and then retires it after it ensures that it is finished delivering records to the destination. The StartDeliveryStreamEncryption and StopDeliveryStreamEncryption operations have a combined limit of 25 calls per Firehose stream per 24 hours. For example, you reach the limit if you call StartDeliveryStreamEncryption 13 times and StopDeliveryStreamEncryption 12 times for the same Firehose stream in a 24-hour period.
