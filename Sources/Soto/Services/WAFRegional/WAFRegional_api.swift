///  This is AWS WAF Classic Regional documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.  For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   This is the AWS WAF Regional Classic API Reference for using AWS WAF Classic with the AWS resources, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) Application Load Balancers and API Gateway APIs. The AWS WAF Classic actions and data types listed in the reference are available for protecting Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) Application Load Balancers and API Gateway APIs. You can use these actions and data types by means of the endpoints listed in AWS Regions and Endpoints. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the AWS WAF Classic API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about AWS WAF Classic features and an overview of how to use the AWS WAF Classic API, see the  AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.

For the latest version of AWS WAF, use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide. With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.   Creates a RateBasedRule. The RateBasedRule contains a RateLimit, which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP address in a five-minute period.   The RateBasedRule also contains the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the RateLimit. If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule, a request not only must exceed the RateLimit, but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a RateBasedRule:   An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32    A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header   Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000. You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot. Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops below 1,000 for a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests.
