/// AWS Elastic Beanstalk AWS Elastic Beanstalk makes it easy for you to create, deploy, and manage scalable, fault-tolerant applications running on the Amazon Web Services cloud. For more information about this product, go to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk details page. The location of the latest AWS Elastic Beanstalk WSDL is https://elasticbeanstalk.s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2010-12-01/AWSElasticBeanstalk.wsdl. To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that enable you to access the API, go to Tools for Amazon Web Services.

    ///   - optionSettings: Option values for the Elastic Beanstalk configuration, such as the instance type. If specified, these values override the values obtained from the solution stack or the source configuration template. For a complete list of Elastic Beanstalk configuration options, see Option Values in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide.
