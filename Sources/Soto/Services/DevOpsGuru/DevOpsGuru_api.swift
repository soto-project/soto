/// Service object for interacting with AWS DevOpsGuru service.
///
///  Amazon DevOps Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify anomalous behavior in
/// 			business critical operational applications. You specify the Amazon Web Services resources that you
/// 			want DevOps Guru to cover, then the Amazon CloudWatch metrics and Amazon Web Services CloudTrail events related to those
/// 			resources are analyzed. When anomalous behavior is detected, DevOps Guru creates an
/// 				insight that includes recommendations, related events, and
/// 			related metrics that can help you improve your operational applications. For more
/// 			information, see What is Amazon DevOps Guru.  You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics so you are notified every time a new insight
/// 			is created. You can also enable DevOps Guru to generate an OpsItem in Amazon Web Services Systems Manager for each
/// 			insight to help you manage and track your work addressing insights.  To learn about the DevOps Guru workflow, see How DevOps Guru works. To
/// 			learn about DevOps Guru concepts, see Concepts in DevOps Guru.
