/// Service object for interacting with AWS CloudTrail service.
///
/// CloudTrail This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail. CloudTrail is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service.  As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide programmatic access to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services.  See the CloudTrail User Guide for information about the data that is included with each Amazon Web Services API call listed in the log files.

    ///   - billingMode: The billing mode for the event data store determines the cost for ingesting events and the default and maximum retention period for the event data store. The following are the possible values:    EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING - This billing mode is generally recommended if you want a flexible retention period of up to 3653 days (about 10 years).  The default retention period for this billing mode is 366 days.    FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING - This billing mode is recommended if you expect to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and need a retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years).  The default retention period for this billing mode is 2557 days.   The default value is EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING. For more information about CloudTrail pricing,  see CloudTrail Pricing and  Managing CloudTrail Lake costs.
    ///   - kmsKeyId: Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by alias/, a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.  Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to the event data store, and prevents users from querying the data in the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store, delete or back up your event data store.  CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide. Examples:    alias/MyAliasName     arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:alias/MyAliasName     arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012     12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012
    ///   - multiRegionEnabled: Specifies whether the event data store includes events from all Regions, or only from the Region in which the event data store is created.
    ///   - name: The name of the event data store.
    ///   - organizationEnabled: Specifies whether an event data store collects events logged for an organization in Organizations.
    ///   - retentionPeriod: The retention period of the event data store, in days. If BillingMode is set to EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING, you can set a retention period of up to 3653 days, the equivalent of 10 years. If BillingMode is set to FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING, you can set a retention period of up to 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years. CloudTrail  Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if the eventTime  of the event is within the specified retention period. For example, if you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail will remove events  when the eventTime is older than 90 days.  If you plan to copy trail events to this event data store, we recommend  that you consider both the age of the events that you want to copy as well as how long you want to keep the copied events in your event data store. For example, if you copy trail events that are 5 years old  and specify a retention period of 7 years, the event data store  will retain those events for two years.

If BillingMode is set to  EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING and you want to use FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING instead, you'll need to stop ingestion on the event data store and create a new event data store that uses FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING.  The billing mode for the event data store determines the cost  for ingesting events and the default and maximum retention period for the event data store. The following are the possible values:    EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING - This billing mode is generally recommended if you want a flexible retention period of up to 3653 days (about 10 years). The default retention period for this billing mode is  366 days.    FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING - This billing mode is recommended if you expect to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and need a retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years).  The default retention period for this billing mode is 2557 days.   For more information about CloudTrail pricing,  see CloudTrail Pricing and  Managing CloudTrail Lake costs.
    ///   - eventDataStore: The ARN (or the ID suffix of the ARN) of the event data store that you want to update.
    ///   - kmsKeyId: Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by alias/, a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.  Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to the event data store, and prevents users from querying the data in the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store, delete or back up your event data store.  CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

Only the management account for the organization can convert an organization event data store to a non-organization event data store, or convert a non-organization event data store to  an organization event data store.
    ///   - retentionPeriod: The retention period of the event data store, in days. If BillingMode is set to EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING, you can set a retention period of up to 3653 days, the equivalent of 10 years. If BillingMode is set to FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING, you can set a retention period of up to 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years. CloudTrail  Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if the eventTime  of the event is within the specified retention period. For example, if you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail will remove events  when the eventTime is older than 90 days.  If you decrease the retention period of an event data store, CloudTrail will remove any events with an eventTime older than the new retention period. For example, if the previous  retention period was 365 days and you decrease it to 100 days, CloudTrail  will remove events with an eventTime older than 100 days.

When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain of digest files is broken after one hour. CloudTrail does not create digest files for log files that were delivered during a period in which log file integrity validation was disabled. For example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on January 1, disable it at noon on January 2, and re-enable it at noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10.

If the trail exists in all Regions and this value is set to false, the trail will remain in the Region where it was created, and its shadow trails in other Regions will be deleted. As a best practice, consider using trails that log events in all Regions.

The default is false, and cannot be true unless the call is made on behalf of an Amazon Web Services account that is the management account for an organization in Organizations. If the trail is not an organization trail and this is set to true, the trail will be created in all Amazon Web Services accounts that belong to the organization. If the trail is an organization trail and this is set to false, the trail will remain in the current Amazon Web Services account but be deleted from all member accounts in the organization.
