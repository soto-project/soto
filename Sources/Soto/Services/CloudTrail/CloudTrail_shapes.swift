For event data stores for CloudTrail Insights events, Config configuration items, Audit Manager evidence, or events outside of Amazon Web Services, the only supported field is eventCategory.      readOnly - Optional. Can be set to Equals a value of true or false. If you do not add this field, CloudTrail logs both read and write events. A value of true logs only read events. A value of false logs only write events.     eventSource - For filtering management events only. This can be set to NotEquals kms.amazonaws.com or NotEquals rdsdata.amazonaws.com.     eventName - Can use any operator. You can use it to ﬁlter in or ﬁlter out any data event logged to CloudTrail, such as PutBucket or GetSnapshotBlock. You can have multiple values for this ﬁeld, separated by commas.     eventCategory - This is required and must be set to Equals.

For Audit Manager evidence, the value must be Evidence.     For non-Amazon Web Services events, the value must be ActivityAuditLog.        resources.type - This ﬁeld is required for CloudTrail data events. resources.type can only use the Equals operator, and the value can be one of the following:    AWS::DynamoDB::Table     AWS::Lambda::Function     AWS::S3::Object     AWS::AppConfig::Configuration     AWS::B2BI::Transformer     AWS::Bedrock::AgentAlias     AWS::Bedrock::KnowledgeBase     AWS::Cassandra::Table     AWS::CloudFront::KeyValueStore     AWS::CloudTrail::Channel     AWS::CodeWhisperer::Customization     AWS::CodeWhisperer::Profile     AWS::Cognito::IdentityPool     AWS::DynamoDB::Stream     AWS::EC2::Snapshot     AWS::EMRWAL::Workspace     AWS::FinSpace::Environment     AWS::Glue::Table     AWS::GreengrassV2::ComponentVersion     AWS::GreengrassV2::Deployment     AWS::GuardDuty::Detector     AWS::IoT::Certificate     AWS::IoT::Thing     AWS::IoTSiteWise::Asset     AWS::IoTSiteWise::TimeSeries     AWS::IoTTwinMaker::Entity     AWS::IoTTwinMaker::Workspace     AWS::KendraRanking::ExecutionPlan     AWS::KinesisVideo::Stream     AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Network     AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node     AWS::MedicalImaging::Datastore     AWS::NeptuneGraph::Graph     AWS::PCAConnectorAD::Connector     AWS::QBusiness::Application     AWS::QBusiness::DataSource     AWS::QBusiness::Index     AWS::QBusiness::WebExperience     AWS::RDS::DBCluster     AWS::S3::AccessPoint     AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint     AWS::S3Outposts::Object     AWS::SageMaker::Endpoint     AWS::SageMaker::ExperimentTrialComponent     AWS::SageMaker::FeatureGroup     AWS::ServiceDiscovery::Namespace      AWS::ServiceDiscovery::Service     AWS::SCN::Instance     AWS::SNS::PlatformEndpoint     AWS::SNS::Topic     AWS::SWF::Domain     AWS::SQS::Queue     AWS::SSMMessages::ControlChannel     AWS::ThinClient::Device     AWS::ThinClient::Environment     AWS::Timestream::Database     AWS::Timestream::Table     AWS::VerifiedPermissions::PolicyStore    You can have only one resources.type ﬁeld per selector. To log data events on more than one resource type, add another selector.     resources.ARN - You can use any operator with resources.ARN, but if you use Equals or NotEquals, the value must exactly match the ARN of a valid resource of the type you've speciﬁed in the template as the value of resources.type. For example, if resources.type equals AWS::S3::Object, the ARN must be in one of the following formats. To log all data events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket ARN as the matching value.

If BillingMode is set to FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING, you can set a retention period of up to 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years. CloudTrail  Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if the eventTime  of the event is within the specified retention period. For example, if you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail will remove events  when the eventTime is older than 90 days.

The billing mode for the event data store determines the cost  for ingesting events and the default and maximum retention period for the event data store. The following are the possible values:    EXTENDABLE_RETENTION_PRICING - This billing mode is generally recommended if you want a flexible retention period of up to 3653 days (about 10 years). The default retention period for this billing mode is  366 days.    FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING - This billing mode is recommended if you expect to ingest more than 25 TB of event data per month and need a retention period of up to 2557 days (about 7 years).

The value can be an alias name prefixed by alias/, a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.  Disabling or deleting the KMS key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on the key, prevents CloudTrail from logging events to the event data store, and prevents users from querying the data in the event data store that was encrypted with the key. After you associate an event data store with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed. Before you disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an event data store, delete or back up your event data store.  CloudTrail also supports KMS multi-Region keys. For more information about multi-Region keys, see Using multi-Region keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.

If BillingMode is set to FIXED_RETENTION_PRICING, you can set a retention period of up to 2557 days, the equivalent of seven years. CloudTrail  Lake determines whether to retain an event by checking if the eventTime  of the event is within the specified retention period. For example, if you set a retention period of 90 days, CloudTrail will remove events  when the eventTime is older than 90 days.  If you decrease the retention period of an event data store, CloudTrail will remove any events with an eventTime older than the new retention period. For example, if the previous  retention period was 365 days and you decrease it to 100 days, CloudTrail  will remove events with an eventTime older than 100 days.
