    /// Associates an Amazon VPC with a private hosted zone.   To perform the association, the VPC and the private hosted zone must already exist. You can't convert a public hosted zone into a private hosted zone.   If you want to associate a VPC that was created by using one Amazon Web Services account with a private hosted zone that was created by using a different account, the Amazon Web Services account that created the private hosted zone must first submit a CreateVPCAssociationAuthorization request. Then the account that created the VPC must submit an AssociateVPCWithHostedZone request.

    }

    /// Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains authoritative DNS information for a specified domain name or subdomain name. For example, you can use ChangeResourceRecordSets to create a resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.  Deleting Resource Record Sets  To delete a resource record set, you must specify all the same values that you specified when you created it.  Change Batches and Transactional Changes  The request body must include a document with a ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. Route 53 validates the changes in the request and then either makes all or none of the changes in the change batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely affected by partial changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone.  For example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it deletes the CNAME resource record set for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. If validation for both records succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If validation for either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails, then the request is canceled, and the original CNAME record continues to exist.  If you try to delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch, Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.   Traffic Flow  To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn't performing as expected. For more information, see Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.  Create, Delete, and Upsert  Use ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions:    CREATE: Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.    DELETE: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified values.    UPSERT: If a resource record set does not already exist, Amazon Web Services creates it. If a resource set does exist, Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.     Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets  The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order listed in the syntax.  For an example for each type of resource record set, see "Examples." Don't refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set that you can create, delete, or update by using ChangeResourceRecordSets.   Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers  When you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, GetChange returns a status of PENDING. When propagation is complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC. Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds. For more information, see GetChange.  Limits on ChangeResourceRecordSets Requests  For information about the limits on a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, see Limits in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

    /// Creates a new health check. For information about adding health checks to resource record sets, see HealthCheckId in ChangeResourceRecordSets.   ELB Load Balancers  If you're registering EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances. When you register an EC2 instance with a load balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, which performs a similar function to a Route 53 health check.  Private Hosted Zones  You can associate health checks with failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone. Note the following:   Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public IP address to the instance in the VPC.   You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server.   You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the Amazon EC2 StatusCheckFailed metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the alarm. For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the CloudWatch console, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

    /// Creates a new public or private hosted zone. You create records in a public hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic on the internet for a domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (apex.example.com, acme.example.com). You create records in a private hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs).   You can't convert a public hosted zone to a private hosted zone or vice versa. Instead, you must create a new hosted zone with the same name and create new resource record sets.  For more information about charges for hosted zones, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing. Note the following:   You can't create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD) such as .com.   For public hosted zones, Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA record and four NS records for the zone. For more information about SOA and NS records, see NS and SOA Records that Route 53 Creates for a Hosted Zone in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. If you want to use the same name servers for multiple public hosted zones, you can optionally associate a reusable delegation set with the hosted zone. See the DelegationSetId element.   If your domain is registered with a registrar other than Route 53, you must update the name servers with your registrar to make Route 53 the DNS service for the domain. For more information, see Migrating DNS Service for an Existing Domain to Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.    When you submit a CreateHostedZone request, the initial status of the hosted zone is PENDING. For public hosted zones, this means that the NS and SOA records are not yet available on all Route 53 DNS servers. When the NS and SOA records are available, the status of the zone changes to INSYNC. The CreateHostedZone request requires the caller to have an ec2:DescribeVpcs permission.
    public func createHostedZone(_ input: CreateHostedZoneRequest, logger: Logger = AWSClient.loggingDisabled, on eventLoop: EventLoop? = nil) -> EventLoopFuture<CreateHostedZoneResponse> {

    /// Creates a configuration for DNS query logging. After you create a query logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log data to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group. DNS query logs contain information about the queries that Route 53 receives for a specified public hosted zone, such as the following:   Route 53 edge location that responded to the DNS query   Domain or subdomain that was requested   DNS record type, such as A or AAAA   DNS response code, such as NoError or ServFail     Log Group and Resource Policy  Before you create a query logging configuration, perform the following operations.  If you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 console, Route 53 performs these operations automatically.    Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you create a query logging configuration. Note the following:   You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.   You must use the same Amazon Web Services account to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for.   When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent prefix, for example:  /aws/route53/hosted zone name   In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log groups and the associated Amazon Web Services resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query logging.     Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. For the value of Resource, specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with *, for example:  arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*   You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You must use the CloudWatch API, one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, or the CLI.     Log Streams and Edge Locations  When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging, it does the following:   Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to for that edge location.   Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.   The name of each log stream is in the following format:   hosted zone ID/edge location code   The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The Route 53 Global Network" on the Route 53 Product Details page.  Queries That Are Logged  Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set, and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain information about only one query out of every several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS. For more information about how DNS works, see Routing Internet Traffic to Your Website or Web Application in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.  Log File Format  For a list of the values in each query log and the format of each value, see Logging DNS Queries in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.  Pricing  For information about charges for query logs, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing.  How to Stop Logging  If you want Route 53 to stop sending query logs to CloudWatch Logs, delete the query logging configuration. For more information, see DeleteQueryLoggingConfig.
    public func createQueryLoggingConfig(_ input: CreateQueryLoggingConfigRequest, logger: Logger = AWSClient.loggingDisabled, on eventLoop: EventLoop? = nil) -> EventLoopFuture<CreateQueryLoggingConfigResponse> {
        return self.client.execute(operation: "CreateQueryLoggingConfig", path: "/2013-04-01/queryloggingconfig", httpMethod: .POST, serviceConfig: self.config, input: input, logger: logger, on: eventLoop)

    /// Creates a delegation set (a group of four name servers) that can be reused by multiple hosted zones that were created by the same Amazon Web Services account.  You can also create a reusable delegation set that uses the four name servers that are associated with an existing hosted zone. Specify the hosted zone ID in the CreateReusableDelegationSet request.  You can't associate a reusable delegation set with a private hosted zone.  For information about using a reusable delegation set to configure white label name servers, see Configuring White Label Name Servers. The process for migrating existing hosted zones to use a reusable delegation set is comparable to the process for configuring white label name servers. You need to perform the following steps:   Create a reusable delegation set.   Recreate hosted zones, and reduce the TTL to 60 seconds or less.   Recreate resource record sets in the new hosted zones.   Change the registrar's name servers to use the name servers for the new hosted zones.   Monitor traffic for the website or application.   Change TTLs back to their original values.   If you want to migrate existing hosted zones to use a reusable delegation set, the existing hosted zones can't use any of the name servers that are assigned to the reusable delegation set. If one or more hosted zones do use one or more name servers that are assigned to the reusable delegation set, you can do one of the following:   For small numbers of hosted zones—up to a few hundred—it's relatively easy to create reusable delegation sets until you get one that has four name servers that don't overlap with any of the name servers in your hosted zones.   For larger numbers of hosted zones, the easiest solution is to use more than one reusable delegation set.   For larger numbers of hosted zones, you can also migrate hosted zones that have overlapping name servers to hosted zones that don't have overlapping name servers, then migrate the hosted zones again to use the reusable delegation set.

(The process is the same for public and private hosted zones that were created by another service.) If you want to keep your domain registration but you want to stop routing internet traffic to your website or web application, we recommend that you delete resource record sets in the hosted zone instead of deleting the hosted zone.  If you delete a hosted zone, you can't undelete it. You must create a new hosted zone and update the name servers for your domain registration, which can require up to 48 hours to take effect. (If you delegated responsibility for a subdomain to a hosted zone and you delete the child hosted zone, you must update the name servers in the parent hosted zone.) In addition, if you delete a hosted zone, someone could hijack the domain and route traffic to their own resources using your domain name.  If you want to avoid the monthly charge for the hosted zone, you can transfer DNS service for the domain to a free DNS service. When you transfer DNS service, you have to update the name servers for the domain registration. If the domain is registered with Route 53, see UpdateDomainNameservers for information about how to replace Route 53 name servers with name servers for the new DNS service. If the domain is registered with another registrar, use the method provided by the registrar to update name servers for the domain registration. For more information, perform an internet search on "free DNS service." You can delete a hosted zone only if it contains only the default SOA record and NS resource record sets.

If you try to delete a hosted zone that contains other resource record sets, the request fails, and Route 53 returns a HostedZoneNotEmpty error. For information about deleting records from your hosted zone, see ChangeResourceRecordSets.
