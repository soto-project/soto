/// hybrid environments, such as in-house or SaaS applications hosted on-premises or in the cloud,
/// virtual machines, or containers. You can store, access, analyze, troubleshoot and take action on
/// this data without maintaining multiple log aggregators and reporting tools. After you run
/// PutAuditEvents to ingest your application activity into CloudTrail, you can use CloudTrail Lake to search, query, and analyze the data that is logged
/// from your applications.
