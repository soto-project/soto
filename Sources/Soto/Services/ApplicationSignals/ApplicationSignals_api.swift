/// Service object for interacting with AWS ApplicationSignals service.
///
///  This is a Preview release of the Application Signals API Reference. Operations and parameters are subject to change before the general availability release.  Use CloudWatch Application Signals for comprehensive observability of your cloud-based applications.  It enables real-time service health dashboards and helps you track long-term performance trends against your business goals.  The application-centric view provides you with unified visibility across your applications, services, and  dependencies, so you can proactively monitor and efficiently triage any issues that may arise,  ensuring optimal customer experience. Application Signals provides the following benefits:   Automatically collect metrics and traces from your applications, and display key metrics such as call volume, availability, latency, faults, and errors.    Create and monitor service level objectives (SLOs).    See a map of your application topology that Application Signals automatically discovers, that gives you a visual representation of your applications, dependencies, and their connectivity.

    // MARK: API Calls

    /// Use this operation to retrieve one or more service level objective (SLO) budget reports. An error budget is the amount of time in unhealthy periods that your service can  accumulate during an interval before your overall SLO budget health is breached and the SLO is considered to be unmet. For example, an SLO with a threshold of 99.95% and a monthly interval translates to an error budget of 21.9 minutes of  downtime in a 30-day month. Budget reports include a health indicator, the attainment value, and  remaining budget. For more information about SLO error budgets, see   SLO concepts.
    @Sendable
    public func batchGetServiceLevelObjectiveBudgetReport(_ input: BatchGetServiceLevelObjectiveBudgetReportInput, logger: Logger = AWSClient.loggingDisabled) async throws -> BatchGetServiceLevelObjectiveBudgetReportOutput {

            operation: "BatchGetServiceLevelObjectiveBudgetReport", 
            path: "/budget-report", 
            httpMethod: .POST, 
            serviceConfig: self.config,

            logger: logger
        )
    }

    /// Creates a service level objective (SLO), which can help you ensure that your critical business operations are  meeting customer expectations. Use SLOs to set and track specific target levels for the reliability and availability of your applications and services. SLOs use service level indicators (SLIs) to  calculate whether the application is performing at the level that you want. Create an SLO to set a target for a service or operationâ€™s availability or latency. CloudWatch measures this target frequently you can find whether it has been breached.  When you create an SLO, you set an attainment goal for it.  An  attainment goal is the  ratio of good periods that meet the threshold requirements to the total periods within the interval.  For example, an attainment goal of 99.9% means that within your interval, you are targeting 99.9% of the  periods to be in healthy state. After you have created an SLO, you can retrieve error budget reports for it.  An error budget is the number of periods or amount of time that your service can  accumulate during an interval before your overall SLO budget health is breached and the SLO is considered to be unmet. for example, an SLO with a threshold that 99.95% of requests must be completed under 2000ms every month  translates to an error budget of 21.9 minutes of downtime per month. When you call this operation, Application Signals creates the AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchApplicationSignals service-linked role,  if it doesn't already exist in your account. This service- linked role has the following permissions:    xray:GetServiceGraph     logs:StartQuery     logs:GetQueryResults     cloudwatch:GetMetricData     cloudwatch:ListMetrics     tag:GetResources     autoscaling:DescribeAutoScalingGroups    You can easily set SLO targets for your applications that are discovered by Application Signals, using critical metrics such as latency and availability.  You can also set SLOs against any CloudWatch metric or math expression that produces a time series. For more information about SLOs, see  Service level objectives (SLOs).
