    ///  Compares a face in the source input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the target input image.    If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image.   You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.  In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match.   By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the SimilarityThreshold parameter.   CompareFaces also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use QualityFilter to set the quality bar by specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE. The default value is NONE.  If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, CompareFaces returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation. If no faces are detected in the source or target images, CompareFaces returns an InvalidParameterException error.    This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.  For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:CompareFaces action.

You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.   For each object that the model version detects on an image, the API returns a (CustomLabel) object in an array (CustomLabels). Each CustomLabel object provides the label name (Name), the level of confidence that the image contains the object (Confidence), and object location information, if it exists, for the label on the image (Geometry).  During training model calculates a threshold value that determines if a prediction for a label is true. By default, DetectCustomLabels doesn't return labels whose confidence value is below the model's calculated threshold value. To filter labels that are returned, specify a value for MinConfidence that is higher than the model's calculated threshold. You can get the model's calculated threshold from the model's training results shown in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels console. To get all labels, regardless of confidence, specify a MinConfidence value of 0.  You can also add the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned.  This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:DetectCustomLabels action.

    ///  Detects faces within an image that is provided as input.  DetectFaces detects the 100 largest faces in the image. For each face detected, the operation returns face details. These details include a bounding box of the face, a confidence value (that the bounding box contains a face), and a fixed set of attributes such as facial landmarks (for example, coordinates of eye and mouth), presence of beard, sunglasses, and so on.  The face-detection algorithm is most effective on frontal faces. For non-frontal or obscured faces, the algorithm might not detect the faces or might detect faces with lower confidence.  You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.   This is a stateless API operation.

    ///  Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided as input. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; and concepts like landscape, evening, and nature.  For an example, see Analyzing Images Stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.   DetectLabels does not support the detection of activities. However, activity detection is supported for label detection in videos. For more information, see StartLabelDetection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.  You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.   For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each label provides the object name, and the level of confidence that the image contains the object. For example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object.   {Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}   {Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}    {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}  In the preceding example, the operation returns one label for each of the three objects. The operation can also return multiple labels for the same object in the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels.   {Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}   {Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}   {Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}  In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip. In response, the API returns an array of labels. In addition, the response also includes the orientation correction. Optionally, you can specify MinConfidence to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the MaxLabels parameter to limit the number of labels returned.   If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the DetectFaces operation provides.   DetectLabels returns bounding boxes for instances of common object labels in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, for the location of the label on the image. It also includes the confidence by which the bounding box was detected.  DetectLabels also returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response returns the entire list of ancestors for a label. Each ancestor is a unique label in the response. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response.  This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:DetectLabels action.

The image must be either a PNG or JPG formatted file.   DetectProtectiveEquipment detects PPE worn by up to 15 persons detected in an image. For each person detected in the image the API returns an array of body parts (face, head, left-hand, right-hand). For each body part, an array of detected items of PPE is returned, including an indicator of whether or not the PPE covers the body part. The API returns the confidence it has in each detection (person, PPE, body part and body part coverage). It also returns a bounding box (BoundingBox) for each detected person and each detected item of PPE.  You can optionally request a summary of detected PPE items with the SummarizationAttributes input parameter. The summary provides the following information.    The persons detected as wearing all of the types of PPE that you specify.   The persons detected as not wearing all of the types PPE that you specify.   The persons detected where PPE adornment could not be determined.    This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data.

The image must be either a .png or .jpeg formatted file.  The DetectText operation returns text in an array of TextDetection elements, TextDetections. Each TextDetection element provides information about a single word or line of text that was detected in the image.  A word is one or more ISO basic latin script characters that are not separated by spaces. DetectText can detect up to 50 words in an image. A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a complete sentence. For example, a driver's license number is detected as a line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends when there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words. This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition may detect multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't represent the end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the DetectText operation returns multiple lines. To determine whether a TextDetection element is a line of text or a word, use the TextDetection object Type field.  To be detected, text must be within +/- 90 degrees orientation of the horizontal axis. For more information, see DetectText in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

    ///  Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection.  Amazon Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the SearchFaces and SearchFacesByImage operations. For more information, see Adding Faces to a Collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. To get the number of faces in a collection, call DescribeCollection.  If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, IndexFaces indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image.  If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not returned in the OrientationCorrection field.  To determine which version of the model you're using, call DescribeCollection and supply the collection ID. You can also get the model version from the value of FaceModelVersion in the response from IndexFaces  For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. If you provide the optional ExternalImageId for the input image you provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the ListFaces operation, the response returns the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index to find all faces in an image. You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the MaxFaces input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don't want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. By default, IndexFaces chooses the quality bar that's used to filter faces. You can also explicitly choose the quality bar. Use QualityFilter, to set the quality bar by specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE.   To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call DescribeCollection.   Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of UnindexedFace objects, UnindexedFaces. Faces aren't indexed for reasons such as:   The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the MaxFaces request parameter.   The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.   The face is too blurry.   The image is too dark.   The face has an extreme pose.   The face doesn’t have enough detail to be suitable for face search.   In response, the IndexFaces operation returns an array of metadata for all detected faces, FaceRecords. This includes:    The bounding box, BoundingBox, of the detected face.    A confidence value, Confidence, which indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a face.   A face ID, FaceId, assigned by the service for each face that's detected and stored.   An image ID, ImageId, assigned by the service for the input image.   If you request all facial attributes (by using the detectionAttributes parameter), Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth) and other facial attributes. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the IndexFaces operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't save duplicate face metadata.  The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket.
