    // MARK: API Calls

    /// Associates one or more faces with an existing UserID. Takes an array of FaceIds. Each FaceId that are present in the FaceIds list is associated with the provided UserID. The maximum number of total FaceIds per UserID is 100.  The UserMatchThreshold parameter specifies the minimum user match confidence required for the face to be associated with a UserID that has at least one FaceID already associated. This ensures that the FaceIds are associated with the right UserID. The value ranges from 0-100 and default value is 75.  If successful, an array of AssociatedFace objects containing the associated FaceIds is returned. If a given face is already associated with the given UserID, it will be ignored and will not be returned in the response. If a given face is already associated to a different UserID, isn't found in the collection, doesn’t meet the UserMatchThreshold, or there are already 100 faces associated with the UserID, it will be returned as part of an array of UnsuccessfulFaceAssociations.  The UserStatus reflects the status of an operation which updates a UserID representation with a list of given faces. The UserStatus can be:    ACTIVE - All associations or disassociations of FaceID(s) for a UserID are complete.   CREATED - A UserID has been created, but has no FaceID(s) associated with it.   UPDATING - A UserID is being updated and there are current associations or disassociations of FaceID(s) taking place.

    /// Compares a face in the source input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the target input image.  If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image.   CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic. A false negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face in the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives, we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images. If you plan to use CompareFaces to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further validation before taking action.  You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.  In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, roll, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match.   By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the SimilarityThreshold parameter.   CompareFaces also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use QualityFilter to set the quality bar by specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE. The default value is NONE.  If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, CompareFaces returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation. If no faces are detected in the source or target images, CompareFaces returns an InvalidParameterException error.   This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.  For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:CompareFaces action.

To copy a model version to a different AWS account, you need to create a resource-based policy known as a project policy. You attach the project policy to the source project by calling PutProjectPolicy. The project policy gives permission to copy the model version from a trusting AWS account to a trusted account.

If you are copying a model version to a project in the same AWS account, you don't need to create a project policy.  Copying project versions is supported only for Custom Labels models.

Amazon Rekognition Video is a consumer of live video from Amazon Kinesis Video Streams. There are two different settings for stream processors in Amazon Rekognition: detecting faces and detecting labels.   If you are creating a stream processor for detecting faces, you provide as input a Kinesis video stream (Input) and a Kinesis data stream (Output) stream for receiving the output. You must use the FaceSearch option in Settings, specifying the collection that contains the faces you want to recognize. After you have finished analyzing a streaming video, use StopStreamProcessor to stop processing.   If you are creating a stream processor to detect labels, you provide as input a Kinesis video stream (Input), Amazon S3 bucket information (Output), and an Amazon SNS topic ARN (NotificationChannel). You can also provide a KMS key ID to encrypt the data sent to your Amazon S3 bucket. You specify what you want to detect by using the ConnectedHome option in settings, and selecting one of the following: PERSON, PET, PACKAGE, ALL You can also specify where in the frame you want Amazon Rekognition to monitor with RegionsOfInterest. When you run the StartStreamProcessor operation on a label detection stream processor, you input start and stop information to determine the length of the processing time.

You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.   Optional Parameters  You can specify one or both of the GENERAL_LABELS and IMAGE_PROPERTIES feature types when calling the DetectLabels API. Including GENERAL_LABELS will ensure the response includes the labels detected in the input image, while including IMAGE_PROPERTIES will ensure the response includes information about the image quality and color. When using GENERAL_LABELS and/or IMAGE_PROPERTIES you can provide filtering criteria to the Settings parameter. You can filter with sets of individual labels or with label categories. You can specify inclusive filters, exclusive filters, or a combination of inclusive and exclusive filters. For more information on filtering see Detecting Labels in an Image. When getting labels, you can specify MinConfidence to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the MaxLabels parameter to limit the number of labels returned. The default and upper limit is 1000 labels. These arguments are only valid when supplying GENERAL_LABELS as a feature type.  Response Elements  For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. The API returns the following types of information about labels:   Name - The name of the detected label.    Confidence - The level of confidence in the label assigned to a detected object.    Parents - The ancestor labels for a detected label. DetectLabels returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where every ancestor is a unique label. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response.    Aliases - Possible Aliases for the label.    Categories - The label categories that the detected label belongs to.    BoundingBox — Bounding boxes are described for all instances of detected common object labels, returned in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, describing the location of the label on the input image. It also includes the confidence for the accuracy of the detected bounding box.    The API returns the following information regarding the image, as part of the ImageProperties structure:   Quality - Information about the Sharpness, Brightness, and Contrast of the input image, scored between 0 to 100. Image quality is returned for the entire image, as well as the background and the foreground.    Dominant Color - An array of the dominant colors in the image.    Foreground - Information about the sharpness, brightness, and dominant colors of the input image’s foreground.    Background - Information about the sharpness, brightness, and dominant colors of the input image’s background.   The list of returned labels will include at least one label for every detected object, along with information about that label. In the following example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object, as well as the confidence in the label:  {Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}   {Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}   {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}  The list of labels can include multiple labels for the same object. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels.   {Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}   {Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}   {Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}  In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.  If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the DetectFaces operation provides.  This is a stateless API operation that doesn't return any data. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:DetectLabels action.

The image must be either a .png or .jpeg formatted file.  The DetectText operation returns text in an array of TextDetection elements, TextDetections. Each TextDetection element provides information about a single word or line of text that was detected in the image.  A word is one or more script characters that are not separated by spaces. DetectText can detect up to 100 words in an image. A line is a string of equally spaced words. A line isn't necessarily a complete sentence. For example, a driver's license number is detected as a line. A line ends when there is no aligned text after it. Also, a line ends when there is a large gap between words, relative to the length of the words. This means, depending on the gap between words, Amazon Rekognition may detect multiple lines in text aligned in the same direction. Periods don't represent the end of a line. If a sentence spans multiple lines, the DetectText operation returns multiple lines. To determine whether a TextDetection element is a line of text or a word, use the TextDetection object Type field.

To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetLabelDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartLabelDetection.  GetLabelDetection returns an array of detected labels (Labels) sorted by the time the labels were detected. You can also sort by the label name by specifying NAME for the SortBy input parameter.  If there is no NAME specified, the default sort is by timestamp. You can select how results are aggregated by using the AggregateBy input parameter. The default aggregation method is TIMESTAMPS. You can also aggregate by SEGMENTS, which aggregates all instances of labels detected in a given segment.  The returned Labels array may include the following attributes:   Name - The name of the detected label.   Confidence - The level of confidence in the label assigned to a detected object.    Parents - The ancestor labels for a detected label. GetLabelDetection returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where every ancestor is a unique label. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response.    Aliases - Possible Aliases for the label.    Categories - The label categories that the detected label belongs to.   BoundingBox — Bounding boxes are described for all instances of detected common object labels,  returned in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, describing  the location of the label on the input image. It also includes the confidence for the accuracy of the detected bounding box.   Timestamp - Time, in milliseconds from the start of the video, that the label was detected. For aggregation by SEGMENTS,  the StartTimestampMillis, EndTimestampMillis, and DurationMillis structures are what define a segment. Although the “Timestamp” structure is still returned with each label, its value is set to be the same as StartTimestampMillis.   Timestamp and Bounding box information are returned for detected Instances, only if aggregation is done by TIMESTAMPS. If aggregating by SEGMENTS, information about detected instances isn’t returned.  The version of the label model used for the detection is also returned.  Note DominantColors isn't returned for Instances, although it is shown as part of the response in the sample seen below.  Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned.

    /// Detects faces in the input image and adds them to the specified collection.  Amazon Rekognition doesn't save the actual faces that are detected. Instead, the underlying detection algorithm first detects the faces in the input image. For each face, the algorithm extracts facial features into a feature vector, and stores it in the backend database. Amazon Rekognition uses feature vectors when it performs face match and search operations using the SearchFaces and SearchFacesByImage operations. For more information, see Adding faces to a collection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. To get the number of faces in a collection, call DescribeCollection.  If you're using version 1.0 of the face detection model, IndexFaces indexes the 15 largest faces in the input image. Later versions of the face detection model index the 100 largest faces in the input image.  If you're using version 4 or later of the face model, image orientation information is not returned in the OrientationCorrection field.  To determine which version of the model you're using, call DescribeCollection and supply the collection ID. You can also get the model version from the value of FaceModelVersion in the response from IndexFaces  For more information, see Model Versioning in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. If you provide the optional ExternalImageId for the input image you provided, Amazon Rekognition associates this ID with all faces that it detects. When you call the ListFaces operation, the response returns the external ID. You can use this external image ID to create a client-side index to associate the faces with each image. You can then use the index to find all faces in an image. You can specify the maximum number of faces to index with the MaxFaces input parameter. This is useful when you want to index the largest faces in an image and don't want to index smaller faces, such as those belonging to people standing in the background. The QualityFilter input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. By default, IndexFaces chooses the quality bar that's used to filter faces. You can also explicitly choose the quality bar. Use QualityFilter, to set the quality bar by specifying LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify NONE.   To use quality filtering, you need a collection associated with version 3 of the face model or higher. To get the version of the face model associated with a collection, call DescribeCollection.   Information about faces detected in an image, but not indexed, is returned in an array of UnindexedFace objects, UnindexedFaces. Faces aren't indexed for reasons such as:   The number of faces detected exceeds the value of the MaxFaces request parameter.   The face is too small compared to the image dimensions.   The face is too blurry.   The image is too dark.   The face has an extreme pose.   The face doesn’t have enough detail to be suitable for face search.   In response, the IndexFaces operation returns an array of metadata for all detected faces, FaceRecords. This includes:    The bounding box, BoundingBox, of the detected face.    A confidence value, Confidence, which indicates the confidence that the bounding box contains a face.   A face ID, FaceId, assigned by the service for each face that's detected and stored.   An image ID, ImageId, assigned by the service for the input image.   If you request ALL or specific facial attributes (e.g., FACE_OCCLUDED) by using the detectionAttributes parameter, Amazon Rekognition returns detailed facial attributes, such as facial landmarks (for example, location of eye and mouth), facial occlusion, and other facial attributes. If you provide the same image, specify the same collection, and use the same external ID in the IndexFaces operation, Amazon Rekognition doesn't save duplicate face metadata.  The input image is passed either as base64-encoded image bytes, or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file.

RecognizeCelebrities returns the 64 largest faces in the image. It lists the recognized celebrities in the CelebrityFaces array and any unrecognized faces in the UnrecognizedFaces array. RecognizeCelebrities doesn't return celebrities whose faces aren't among the largest 64 faces in the image. For each celebrity recognized, RecognizeCelebrities returns a Celebrity object. The Celebrity object contains the celebrity name, ID, URL links to additional information, match confidence, and a ComparedFace object that you can use to locate the celebrity's face on the image. Amazon Rekognition doesn't retain information about which images a celebrity has been recognized in. Your application must store this information and use the Celebrity ID property as a unique identifier for the celebrity. If you don't store the celebrity name or additional information URLs returned by RecognizeCelebrities, you will need the ID to identify the celebrity in a call to the GetCelebrityInfo operation. You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.  For an example, see Recognizing celebrities in an image in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide. This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:RecognizeCelebrities operation.

    /// Gets the celebrity recognition results for a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by StartCelebrityRecognition. Celebrity recognition in a video is an asynchronous operation. Analysis is started by a call to StartCelebrityRecognition which returns a job identifier (JobId).  When the celebrity recognition operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call to StartCelebrityRecognition. To get the results of the celebrity recognition analysis, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetCelebrityDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartCelebrityDetection.  For more information, see Working With Stored Videos in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.  GetCelebrityRecognition returns detected celebrities and the time(s) they are detected in an array (Celebrities) of CelebrityRecognition objects. Each CelebrityRecognition contains information about the celebrity in a CelebrityDetail object and the time, Timestamp, the celebrity was detected.  This CelebrityDetail object stores information about the detected celebrity's face attributes, a face bounding box, known gender, the celebrity's name, and a confidence estimate.   GetCelebrityRecognition only returns the default facial attributes (BoundingBox, Confidence, Landmarks, Pose, and Quality). The BoundingBox field only applies to the detected face instance. The other facial attributes listed in the Face object of the following response syntax are not returned. For more information, see FaceDetail in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.   By default, the Celebrities array is sorted by time (milliseconds from the start of the video). You can also sort the array by celebrity by specifying the value ID in the SortBy input parameter. The CelebrityDetail object includes the celebrity identifer and additional information urls. If you don't store the additional information urls, you can get them later by calling GetCelebrityInfo with the celebrity identifer. No information is returned for faces not recognized as celebrities. Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned. If there are more results than specified in MaxResults, the value of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination token for getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results, call GetCelebrityDetection and populate the NextToken request parameter with the token value returned from the previous call to GetCelebrityRecognition.

To get the results of the label detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED. If so, call GetLabelDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId) from the initial call to StartLabelDetection.  GetLabelDetection returns an array of detected labels (Labels) sorted by the time the labels were detected. You can also sort by the label name by specifying NAME for the SortBy input parameter.  If there is no NAME specified, the default sort is by timestamp. You can select how results are aggregated by using the AggregateBy input parameter. The default aggregation method is TIMESTAMPS. You can also aggregate by SEGMENTS, which aggregates all instances of labels detected in a given segment.  The returned Labels array may include the following attributes:   Name - The name of the detected label.   Confidence - The level of confidence in the label assigned to a detected object.    Parents - The ancestor labels for a detected label. GetLabelDetection returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandparent). The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where every ancestor is a unique label. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are returned as unique labels in the response.    Aliases - Possible Aliases for the label.    Categories - The label categories that the detected label belongs to.   BoundingBox — Bounding boxes are described for all instances of detected common object labels,  returned in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox object, describing  the location of the label on the input image. It also includes the confidence for the accuracy of the detected bounding box.   Timestamp - Time, in milliseconds from the start of the video, that the label was detected. For aggregation by SEGMENTS,  the StartTimestampMillis, EndTimestampMillis, and DurationMillis structures are what define a segment. Although the “Timestamp” structure is still returned with each label, its value is set to be the same as StartTimestampMillis.   Timestamp and Bounding box information are returned for detected Instances, only if aggregation is done by TIMESTAMPS. If aggregating by SEGMENTS, information about detected instances isn’t returned.  The version of the label model used for the detection is also returned.  Note DominantColors isn't returned for Instances, although it is shown as part of the response in the sample seen below.  Use MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned.
