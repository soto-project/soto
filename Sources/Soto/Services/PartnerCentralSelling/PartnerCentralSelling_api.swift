/// AWS Partner Central API for Selling  AWS Partner Central API for Selling Reference Guide  This Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partner Central API reference is designed to help AWS Partners integrate Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems with AWS Partner Central. Partners can automate interactions with AWS Partner Central, which helps to ensure effective engagements in joint business activities. The API provides standard AWS API functionality. Access it by either using API Actions or by using an AWS SDK that's tailored to your programming language or platform. For more information, see Getting Started with AWS and Tools to Build on AWS.  Features offered by AWS Partner Central API     Opportunity management: Manages coselling opportunities through API actions such as CreateOpportunity, UpdateOpportunity, ListOpportunities, GetOpportunity, and AssignOpportunity.    AWS referral management: Manages referrals shared by AWS using actions such as ListEngagementInvitations, GetEngagementInvitation, StartEngagementByAcceptingInvitation, and RejectEngagementInvitation.    Entity association: Associates related entities such as AWS Products, Partner Solutions, and AWS Marketplace Private Offers with opportunities using the actions AssociateOpportunity, and DisassociateOpportunity.    View AWS opportunity details: Retrieves real-time summaries of AWS opportunities using the GetAWSOpportunitySummary action.    List solutions: Provides list APIs for listing partner offers using ListSolutions.    Event subscription: Subscribe to real-time opportunity updates through AWS EventBridge by using actions such as Opportunity Created, Opportunity Updated, Engagement Invitation Accepted, Engagement Invitation Rejected, and Engagement Invitation Created.

You can use standard libraries from most programming languages to generate this.

    ///   - lifeCycle: An object that contains lifecycle details for the Opportunity.
    ///   - marketing: This object contains marketing details and is optional for an opportunity.
    ///   - nationalSecurity: Indicates whether the Opportunity pertains to a national security project. This field must be set to true only when the customer's industry is Government. Additional privacy and security measures apply during the review and management process for opportunities marked as NationalSecurity.
    ///   - opportunityTeam: Represents the internal team handling the opportunity. Specify collaborating members of this opportunity who are within the partner's organization.
    ///   - opportunityType: Specifies the opportunity type as a renewal, new, or expansion. Opportunity types:   New opportunity: Represents a new business opportunity with a potential customer that's not previously engaged with your solutions or services.   Renewal opportunity: Represents an opportunity to renew an existing contract or subscription with a current customer, ensuring continuity of service.   Expansion opportunity: Represents an opportunity to expand the scope of an existing contract or subscription, either by adding new services or increasing the volume of existing services for a current customer.
    ///   - origin: Specifies the origin of the opportunity, indicating if it was sourced from Amazon Web Services or the partner. For all opportunities created with Catalog: AWS, this field must only be Partner Referral. However, when using Catalog: Sandbox, you can set this field to AWS Referral to simulate Amazon Web Services referral creation. This allows Amazon Web Services-originated flows testing in the sandbox catalog.
    ///   - partnerOpportunityIdentifier: Specifies the opportunity's unique identifier in the partner's CRM system. This value is essential to track and reconcile because it's included in the outbound payload to the partner. This field allows partners to link an opportunity to their CRM, which helps to ensure seamless integration and accurate synchronization between the Partner Central API and the partner's internal systems.
    ///   - primaryNeedsFromAws: Identifies the type of support the partner needs from Amazon Web Services. Valid values:   Cosell—Architectural Validation: Confirmation from Amazon Web Services that the partner's proposed solution architecture is aligned with Amazon Web Services best practices and poses minimal architectural risks.   Cosell—Business Presentation: Request Amazon Web Services seller's participation in a joint customer presentation.   Cosell—Competitive Information: Access to Amazon Web Services competitive resources and support for the partner's proposed solution.   Cosell—Pricing Assistance: Connect with an Amazon Web Services seller for support situations where a partner may be receiving an upfront discount on a service (for example: EDP deals).   Cosell—Technical Consultation: Connect with an Amazon Web Services Solutions Architect to address the partner's questions about the proposed solution.   Cosell—Total Cost of Ownership Evaluation: Assistance with quoting different cost savings of proposed solutions on Amazon Web Services versus on-premises or a traditional hosting environment.
