/// This is the Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority API Reference. It provides descriptions,
/// 			syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types involved in creating
/// 			and managing a private certificate authority (CA) for your organization. The documentation for each action shows the API request parameters and the JSON
/// 			response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is
/// 			tailored to the programming language or platform that you prefer. For more information,
/// 			see Amazon Web Services SDKs. Each Amazon Web Services Private CA API operation has a quota that determines the number of times the
/// 			operation can be called per second. Amazon Web Services Private CA throttles API requests at different rates
/// 			depending on the operation. Throttling means that Amazon Web Services Private CA rejects an otherwise valid
/// 			request because the request exceeds the operation's quota for the number of requests per
/// 			second. When a request is throttled, Amazon Web Services Private CA returns a ThrottlingException error. Amazon Web Services Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request
/// 			rate for APIs.  To see an up-to-date list of your Amazon Web Services Private CA quotas, or to request a quota increase,
/// 			log into your Amazon Web Services account and visit the Service Quotas
/// 			console.
