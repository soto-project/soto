/// This is the ACM Private CA API Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types involved in creating and managing private certificate authorities (CA) for your organization. The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs.  Each ACM Private CA API action has a quota that determines the number of times the action can be called per second. For more information, see API Rate Quotas in ACM Private CA in the ACM Private CA user guide.

    /// Creates a root or subordinate private certificate authority (CA). You must specify the CA configuration, the certificate revocation list (CRL) configuration, the CA type, and an optional idempotency token to avoid accidental creation of multiple CAs. The CA configuration specifies the name of the algorithm and key size to be used to create the CA private key, the type of signing algorithm that the CA uses, and X.500 subject information. The CRL configuration specifies the CRL expiration period in days (the validity period of the CRL), the Amazon S3 bucket that will contain the CRL, and a CNAME alias for the S3 bucket that is included in certificates issued by the CA. If successful, this action returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CA. ACM Private CA assets that are stored in Amazon S3 can be protected with encryption. For more information, see Encrypting Your CRLs.  Both PCA and the IAM principal must have permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify. If the IAM principal making the call does not have permission to write to the bucket, then an exception is thrown. For more information, see Configure Access to ACM Private CA.

About Permissions    If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate renewals.   For automatic certificate renewal to succeed, the ACM service principal needs permissions to create, retrieve, and list certificates.   If the private CA and the ACM certificates reside in different accounts, then permissions cannot be used to enable automatic renewals. Instead, the ACM certificate owner must set up a resource-based policy to enable cross-account issuance and renewals. For more information, see Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA.

You can find the ARN by calling the ListCertificateAuthorities action.   Deleting a CA will invalidate other CAs and certificates below it in your CA hierarchy.  Before you can delete a CA that you have created and activated, you must disable it. To do this, call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action and set the CertificateAuthorityStatus parameter to DISABLED.  Additionally, you can delete a CA if you are waiting for it to be created (that is, the status of the CA is CREATING). You can also delete it if the CA has been created but you haven't yet imported the signed certificate into ACM Private CA (that is, the status of the CA is PENDING_CERTIFICATE).  When you successfully call DeleteCertificateAuthority, the CA's status changes to DELETED. However, the CA won't be permanently deleted until the restoration period has passed. By default, if you do not set the PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parameter, the CA remains restorable for 30 days. You can set the parameter from 7 to 30 days. The DescribeCertificateAuthority action returns the time remaining in the restoration window of a private CA in the DELETED state. To restore an eligible CA, call the RestoreCertificateAuthority action.

Permissions can be granted with the CreatePermission action and listed with the ListPermissions action.   About Permissions    If the private CA and the certificates it issues reside in the same account, you can use CreatePermission to grant permissions for ACM to carry out automatic certificate renewals.

The AWS Certificate Manager Service Linked Role that the policy supports is not affected when you delete the policy.  The current policy can be shown with GetPolicy and updated with PutPolicy.  About Policies    A policy grants access on a private CA to an AWS customer account, to AWS Organizations, or to an AWS Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information, see Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA.   A policy permits a user of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM certificates signed by a CA in another account.   For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates, the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the ACM Private CA policy. For more information, see Using a Service Linked Role with ACM.   Updates made in AWS Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information, see Attach a Policy for Cross-Account Access.

Call the GetCertificateAuthorityCsr action to generate a certificate signing request (CSR).   Sign the CSR using a root or intermediate CA hosted by either an on-premises PKI hierarchy or by a commercial CA.   Create a certificate chain and copy the signed certificate and the certificate chain to your working directory.   ACM Private CA supports three scenarios for installing a CA certificate:   Installing a certificate for a root CA hosted by ACM Private CA.   Installing a subordinate CA certificate whose parent authority is hosted by ACM Private CA.   Installing a subordinate CA certificate whose parent authority is externally hosted.   The following additional requirements apply when you import a CA certificate.   Only a self-signed certificate can be imported as a root CA.   A self-signed certificate cannot be imported as a subordinate CA.   Your certificate chain must not include the private CA certificate that you are importing.   Your root CA must be the last certificate in your chain. The subordinate certificate, if any, that your root CA signed must be next to last. The subordinate certificate signed by the preceding subordinate CA must come next, and so on until your chain is built.    The chain must be PEM-encoded.   The maximum allowed size of a certificate is 32 KB.   The maximum allowed size of a certificate chain is 2 MB.    Enforcement of Critical Constraints  ACM Private CA allows the following extensions to be marked critical in the imported CA certificate or chain.   Basic constraints (must be marked critical)   Subject alternative names   Key usage   Extended key usage   Authority key identifier   Subject key identifier   Issuer alternative name   Subject directory attributes   Subject information access   Certificate policies   Policy mappings   Inhibit anyPolicy   ACM Private CA rejects the following extensions when they are marked critical in an imported CA certificate or chain.
