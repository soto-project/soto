/// You use the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane to manage the encryption keys you use for payment-related cryptographic operations. You can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can also manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys. For more information, see Identity and access management in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.  To use encryption keys for payment-related transaction processing and associated cryptographic operations, you use the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane. You can encrypt, decrypt, generate, verify, and translate payment-related cryptographic operations.  All Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography API calls must be signed and transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We recommend you always use the latest supported TLS version for logging API requests.  Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. If you don't conﬁgure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console. For more information, see the CloudTrail User Guide.

You can use an alias to identify a key in the console and when you call cryptographic operations such as EncryptData or DecryptData. You can associate the alias with any key in the same Amazon Web Services Region. Each alias is associated with only one key at a time, but a key can have multiple aliases. You can't create an alias without a key. The alias must be unique in the account and Amazon Web Services Region, but you can create another alias with the same name in a different Amazon Web Services Region. To change the key that's associated with the alias, call UpdateAlias. To delete the alias, call DeleteAlias. These operations don't affect the underlying key. To get the alias that you created, call ListAliases.  Cross-account use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.

    /// Creates an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key, a logical representation of a cryptographic key, that is unique in your account and Amazon Web Services Region. You use keys for cryptographic functions such as encryption and decryption.  In addition to the key material used in cryptographic operations, an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key includes metadata such as the key ARN, key usage, key origin, creation date, description, and key state. When you create a key, you specify both immutable and mutable data about the key. The immutable data contains key attributes that defines the scope and cryptographic operations that you can perform using the key, for example key class (example: SYMMETRIC_KEY), key algorithm (example: TDES_2KEY), key usage (example: TR31_P0_PIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY) and key modes of use (example: Encrypt). For information about valid combinations of key attributes, see Understanding key attributes in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. The mutable data contained within a key includes usage timestamp and key deletion timestamp and can be modified after creation. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography binds key attributes to keys using key blocks when you store or export them. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography stores the key contents wrapped and never stores or transmits them in the clear.

After a key is deleted, you can't perform cryptographic operations using the key. For example, you can't decrypt data that was encrypted by a deleted Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key, and the data may become unrecoverable. Because key deletion is destructive, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography has a safety mechanism to prevent accidental deletion of a key. When you call this operation, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography disables the specified key but doesn't delete it until after a waiting period. The default waiting period is 7 days. To set a different waiting period, set DeleteKeyInDays. During the waiting period, the KeyState is DELETE_PENDING. After the key is deleted, the KeyState is DELETE_COMPLETE. If you delete key material, you can use ImportKey to reimport the same key material into the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key. You should delete a key only when you are sure that you don't need to use it anymore and no other parties are utilizing this key. If you aren't sure, consider deactivating it instead by calling StopKeyUsage.  Cross-account use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.

Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography simplifies main or root key exchange process by eliminating the need of a paper-based key exchange process. It takes a modern and secure approach based of the ANSI X9 TR-34 key exchange standard. You can use ExportKey to export main or root keys such as KEK (Key Encryption Key), using asymmetric key exchange technique following ANSI X9 TR-34 standard. The ANSI X9 TR-34 standard uses asymmetric keys to establishes bi-directional trust between the two parties exchanging keys. After which you can export working keys using the ANSI X9 TR-31 symmetric key exchange standard as mandated by PCI PIN. Using this operation, you can share your Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography generated keys with other service partners to perform cryptographic operations outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography   TR-34 key export  Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses TR-34 asymmetric key exchange standard to export main keys such as KEK. In TR-34 terminology, the sending party of the key is called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the receiving party of the key is called Key Receiving Host (KRH). In key export process, KDH is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography which initiates key export. KRH is the user receiving the key. Before you initiate TR-34 key export, you must obtain an export token by calling GetParametersForExport. This operation also returns the signing key certificate that KDH uses to sign the wrapped key to generate a TR-34 wrapped key block. The export token expires after 7 days. Set the following parameters:  CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier  The KeyARN of the certificate chain that will sign the wrapping key certificate. This must exist within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography before you initiate TR-34 key export. If it does not exist, you can import it by calling ImportKey for RootCertificatePublicKey.  ExportToken  Obtained from KDH by calling GetParametersForExport.  WrappingKeyCertificate  Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses this to wrap the key under export.   When this operation is successful, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography returns the TR-34 wrapped key block.   TR-31 key export  Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses TR-31 symmetric key exchange standard to export working keys. In TR-31, you must use a main key such as KEK to encrypt or wrap the key under export. To establish a KEK, you can use CreateKey or ImportKey.

KeyModesOfUse and KeyUsage: Corresponding to the cryptographic operations such as wrap, sign, or encrypt that you will allow the trusted public key certificate to perform.    PublicKeyCertificate: The certificate authority used to sign the trusted public key certificate.    Import main keys  Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses TR-34 asymmetric key exchange standard to import main keys such as KEK.

This operation also returns the wrapping key certificate that KDH uses wrap key under import to generate a TR-34 wrapped key block. The import token expires after 7 days. Set the following parameters:    CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier: The KeyArn of the certificate chain that will sign the signing key certificate and should exist within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography before initiating TR-34 key import. If it does not exist, you can import it by calling by calling ImportKey for RootCertificatePublicKey.    ImportToken: Obtained from KRH by calling GetParametersForImport.    WrappedKeyBlock: The TR-34 wrapped key block from KDH. It contains the KDH key under import, wrapped with KRH provided wrapping key certificate and signed by the KDH private signing key. This TR-34 key block is generated by the KDH Hardware Security Module (HSM) outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.    SigningKeyCertificate: The public component of the private key that signed the KDH TR-34 wrapped key block. In PEM certificate format.    TR-34 is intended primarily to exchange 3DES keys. Your ability to export AES-128 and larger AES keys may be dependent on your source system.   Import working keys  Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses TR-31 symmetric key exchange standard to import working keys.
