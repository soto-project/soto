/// Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane APIs manage encryption keys for use during payment-related cryptographic operations. You can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can also manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys. For more information, see Identity and access management in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.  To use encryption keys for payment-related transaction processing and associated cryptographic operations, you use the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane. You can perform actions like encrypt, decrypt, generate, and verify payment-related data. All Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography API calls must be signed and transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We recommend you always use the latest supported TLS version for logging API requests.  Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports CloudTrail for control plane operations, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. If you don't conﬁgure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console. For more information, see the CloudTrail User Guide.

    /// Creates an alias, or a friendly name, for an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key. You can use an alias to identify a key in the console and when you call cryptographic operations such as EncryptData or DecryptData. You can associate the alias with any key in the same Amazon Web Services Region. Each alias is associated with only one key at a time, but a key can have multiple aliases. You can't create an alias without a key. The alias must be unique in the account and Amazon Web Services Region, but you can create another alias with the same name in a different Amazon Web Services Region. To change the key that's associated with the alias, call UpdateAlias. To delete the alias, call DeleteAlias. These operations don't affect the underlying key. To get the alias that you created, call ListAliases.  Cross-account use: This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.

    /// Creates an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key, a logical representation of a cryptographic key, that is unique in your account and Amazon Web Services Region. You use keys for cryptographic functions such as encryption and decryption.  In addition to the key material used in cryptographic operations, an Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key includes metadata such as the key ARN, key usage, key origin, creation date, description, and key state. When you create a key, you specify both immutable and mutable data about the key. The immutable data contains key attributes that define the scope and cryptographic operations that you can perform using the key, for example key class (example: SYMMETRIC_KEY), key algorithm (example: TDES_2KEY), key usage (example: TR31_P0_PIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY) and key modes of use (example: Encrypt). For information about valid combinations of key attributes, see Understanding key attributes in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. The mutable data contained within a key includes usage timestamp and key deletion timestamp and can be modified after creation. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography binds key attributes to keys using key blocks when you store or export them. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography stores the key contents wrapped and never stores or transmits them in the clear.

    /// Deletes the key material and metadata associated with Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key. Key deletion is irreversible. After a key is deleted, you can't perform cryptographic operations using the key. For example, you can't decrypt data that was encrypted by a deleted Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography key, and the data may become unrecoverable. Because key deletion is destructive, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography has a safety mechanism to prevent accidental deletion of a key. When you call this operation, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography disables the specified key but doesn't delete it until after a waiting period set using DeleteKeyInDays. The default waiting period is 7 days. During the waiting period, the KeyState is DELETE_PENDING. After the key is deleted, the KeyState is DELETE_COMPLETE. You should delete a key only when you are sure that you don't need to use it anymore and no other parties are utilizing this key.

    /// Exports a key from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography simplifies key exchange by replacing the existing paper-based approach with a modern electronic approach. With ExportKey you can export symmetric keys using either symmetric and asymmetric key exchange mechanisms. Using this operation, you can share your Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography generated keys with other service partners to perform cryptographic operations outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography  For symmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses the ANSI X9 TR-31 norm in accordance with PCI PIN guidelines. And for asymmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports ANSI X9 TR-34 norm and RSA wrap and unwrap key exchange mechanism. Asymmetric key exchange methods are typically used to establish bi-directional trust between the two parties exhanging keys and are used for initial key exchange such as Key Encryption Key (KEK). After which you can export working keys using symmetric method to perform various cryptographic operations within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. The TR-34 norm is intended for exchanging 3DES keys only and keys are imported in a WrappedKeyBlock format. Key attributes (such as KeyUsage, KeyAlgorithm, KeyModesOfUse, Exportability) are contained within the key block. With RSA wrap and unwrap, you can exchange both 3DES and AES-128 keys. The keys are imported in a WrappedKeyCryptogram format and you will need to specify the key attributes during import.  You can also use ExportKey functionality to generate and export an IPEK (Initial Pin Encryption Key) from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography using either TR-31 or TR-34 export key exchange. IPEK is generated from BDK (Base Derivation Key) and ExportDukptInitialKey attribute KSN (KeySerialNumber). The generated IPEK does not persist within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography and has to be re-generated each time during export.  To export initial keys (KEK) or IPEK using TR-34  Using this operation, you can export initial key using TR-34 asymmetric key exchange. You can only export KEK generated within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. In TR-34 terminology, the sending party of the key is called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the receiving party of the key is called Key Receiving Device (KRD). During key export process, KDH is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography which initiates key export and KRD is the user receiving the key. To initiate TR-34 key export, the KRD must obtain an export token by calling GetParametersForExport. This operation also generates a key pair for the purpose of key export, signs the key and returns back the signing public key certificate (also known as KDH signing certificate) and root certificate chain. The KDH uses the private key to sign the the export payload and the signing public key certificate is provided to KRD to verify the signature. The KRD can import the root certificate into its Hardware Security Module (HSM), as required. The export token and the associated KDH signing certificate expires after 7 days.  Next the KRD generates a key pair for the the purpose of encrypting the KDH key and provides the public key cerificate (also known as KRD wrapping certificate) back to KDH. The KRD will also import the root cerificate chain into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling ImportKey for RootCertificatePublicKey. The KDH, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, will use the KRD wrapping cerificate to encrypt (wrap) the key under export and signs it with signing private key to generate a TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock. For more information on TR-34 key export, see section Exporting symmetric keys in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide.  Set the following parameters:    ExportAttributes: Specify export attributes in case of IPEK export. This parameter is optional for KEK export.    ExportKeyIdentifier: The KeyARN of the KEK or BDK (in case of IPEK) under export.    KeyMaterial: Use Tr34KeyBlock parameters.    CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier: The KeyARN of the certificate chain that signed the KRD wrapping key certificate.    ExportToken: Obtained from KDH by calling GetParametersForImport.    WrappingKeyCertificate: The public key certificate in PEM format (base64 encoded) of the KRD wrapping key Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses for encryption of the TR-34 export payload. This certificate must be signed by the root certificate (CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier) imported into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.   When this operation is successful, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography returns the KEK or IPEK as a TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock.   To export initial keys (KEK) or IPEK using RSA Wrap and Unwrap  Using this operation, you can export initial key using asymmetric RSA wrap and unwrap key exchange method. To initiate export, generate an asymmetric key pair on the receiving HSM and obtain the public key certificate in PEM format (base64 encoded) for the purpose of wrapping and the root certifiate chain. Import the root certificate into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling ImportKey for RootCertificatePublicKey. Next call ExportKey and set the following parameters:    CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier: The KeyARN of the certificate chain that signed wrapping key certificate.    KeyMaterial: Set to KeyCryptogram.    WrappingKeyCertificate: The public key certificate in PEM format (base64 encoded) obtained by the receiving HSM and signed by the root certificate (CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier) imported into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. The receiving HSM uses its private key component to unwrap the WrappedKeyCryptogram.   When this operation is successful, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography returns the WrappedKeyCryptogram.   To export working keys or IPEK using TR-31  Using this operation, you can export working keys or IPEK using TR-31 symmetric key exchange. In TR-31, you must use an initial key such as KEK to encrypt or wrap the key under export. To establish a KEK, you can use CreateKey or ImportKey.  Set the following parameters:    ExportAttributes: Specify export attributes in case of IPEK export. This parameter is optional for KEK export.    ExportKeyIdentifier: The KeyARN of the KEK or BDK (in case of IPEK) under export.    KeyMaterial: Use Tr31KeyBlock parameters.   When this operation is successful, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography returns the working key or IPEK as a TR-31 WrappedKeyBlock.

To import initial keys (KEK or ZMK or similar) using TR-34  Using this operation, you can import initial key using TR-34 asymmetric key exchange. In TR-34 terminology, the sending party of the key is called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the receiving party of the key is called Key Receiving Device (KRD). During the key import process, KDH is the user who initiates the key import and KRD is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography who receives the key.

This operation generates an encryption keypair for the purpose of key import, signs the key and returns back the wrapping key certificate (also known as KRD wrapping certificate) and the root certificate chain. The KDH must trust and install the KRD wrapping certificate on its HSM and use it to encrypt (wrap) the KDH key during TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock generation. The import token and associated KRD wrapping certificate expires after 7 days. Next the KDH generates a key pair for the purpose of signing the encrypted KDH key and provides the public certificate of the signing key to Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. The KDH will also need to import the root certificate chain of the KDH signing certificate by calling ImportKey for RootCertificatePublicKey. For more information on TR-34 key import, see section Importing symmetric keys in the Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide. Set the following parameters:    KeyMaterial: Use Tr34KeyBlock parameters.    CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier: The KeyARN of the certificate chain that signed the KDH signing key certificate.    ImportToken: Obtained from KRD by calling GetParametersForImport.    WrappedKeyBlock: The TR-34 wrapped key material from KDH. It contains the KDH key under import, wrapped with KRD wrapping certificate and signed by KDH signing private key.
