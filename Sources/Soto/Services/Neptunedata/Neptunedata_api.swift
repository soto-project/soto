/// Neptune Data API The Amazon Neptune data API provides SDK support for more than 40 of Neptune's data operations, including data loading, query execution, data inquiry, and machine learning. It supports  the Gremlin and openCypher query languages, and is available in all SDK languages. It automatically signs API requests and greatly simplifies integrating Neptune into your applications.
