    /// This operation aborts a multipart upload identified by the upload ID. After the Abort Multipart Upload request succeeds, you cannot upload any more parts to the multipart upload or complete the multipart upload. Aborting a completed upload fails. However, aborting an already-aborted upload will succeed, for a short time. For more information about uploading a part and completing a multipart upload, see UploadMultipartPart and CompleteMultipartUpload. This operation is idempotent. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions. For more information, see Access Control Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).  For conceptual information and underlying REST API, see Working with Archives in Amazon S3 Glacier and Abort Multipart Upload in the Amazon Glacier Developer Guide.

    /// This operation aborts the vault locking process if the vault lock is not in the Locked state. If the vault lock is in the Locked state when this operation is requested, the operation returns an AccessDeniedException error. Aborting the vault locking process removes the vault lock policy from the specified vault.  A vault lock is put into the InProgress state by calling InitiateVaultLock. A vault lock is put into the Locked state by calling CompleteVaultLock. You can get the state of a vault lock by calling GetVaultLock. For more information about the vault locking process, see Amazon Glacier Vault Lock. For more information about vault lock policies, see Amazon Glacier Access Control with Vault Lock Policies.  This operation is idempotent. You can successfully invoke this operation multiple times, if the vault lock is in the InProgress state or if there is no policy associated with the vault.

    /// This operation adds the specified tags to a vault. Each tag is composed of a key and a value. Each vault can have up to 10 tags. If your request would cause the tag limit for the vault to be exceeded, the operation throws the LimitExceededException error.

    /// You call this operation to inform Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) that all the archive parts have been uploaded and that Glacier can now assemble the archive from the uploaded parts. After assembling and saving the archive to the vault, Glacier returns the URI path of the newly created archive resource. Using the URI path, you can then access the archive. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned to retrieve the archive at a later point. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob. In the request, you must include the computed SHA256 tree hash of the entire archive you have uploaded. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums. On the server side, Glacier also constructs the SHA256 tree hash of the assembled archive. If the values match, Glacier saves the archive to the vault; otherwise, it returns an error, and the operation fails. The ListParts operation returns a list of parts uploaded for a specific multipart upload. It includes checksum information for each uploaded part that can be used to debug a bad checksum issue. Additionally, Glacier also checks for any missing content ranges when assembling the archive, if missing content ranges are found, Glacier returns an error and the operation fails. Complete Multipart Upload is an idempotent operation. After your first successful complete multipart upload, if you call the operation again within a short period, the operation will succeed and return the same archive ID. This is useful in the event you experience a network issue that causes an aborted connection or receive a 500 server error, in which case you can repeat your Complete Multipart Upload request and get the same archive ID without creating duplicate archives. Note, however, that after the multipart upload completes, you cannot call the List Parts operation and the multipart upload will not appear in List Multipart Uploads response, even if idempotent complete is possible. An AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default.

The multipart upload ID is used in subsequent requests to upload parts of an archive (see UploadMultipartPart). When you initiate a multipart upload, you specify the part size in number of bytes. The part size must be a megabyte (1024 KB) multiplied by a power of 2-for example, 1048576 (1 MB), 2097152 (2 MB), 4194304 (4 MB), 8388608 (8 MB), and so on. The minimum allowable part size is 1 MB, and the maximum is 4 GB. Every part you upload to this resource (see UploadMultipartPart), except the last one, must have the same size. The last one can be the same size or smaller. For example, suppose you want to upload a 16.2 MB file. If you initiate the multipart upload with a part size of 4 MB, you will upload four parts of 4 MB each and one part of 0.2 MB.   You don't need to know the size of the archive when you start a multipart upload because Amazon S3 Glacier does not require you to specify the overall archive size.

Retaining completed jobs for a period of time after they have completed enables you to get a job output in the event you miss the job completion notification or your first attempt to download it fails. For example, suppose you start an archive retrieval job to download an archive. After the job completes, you start to download the archive but encounter a network error. In this scenario, you can retry and download the archive while the job exists.  The List Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the response Marker field.

Amazon S3 Glacier returns the archive ID in the x-amz-archive-id header of the response.  You must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon S3 Glacier. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for better searching. You can also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob.  You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums.  You can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII characters. You can get the archive description when you either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. For more information, see InitiateJob. Amazon Glacier does not interpret the description in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive list.

    /// This operation uploads a part of an archive. You can upload archive parts in any order. You can also upload them in parallel. You can upload up to 10,000 parts for a multipart upload. Amazon Glacier rejects your upload part request if any of the following conditions is true:    SHA256 tree hash does not matchTo ensure that part data is not corrupted in transmission, you compute a SHA256 tree hash of the part and include it in your request. Upon receiving the part data, Amazon S3 Glacier also computes a SHA256 tree hash. If these hash values don't match, the operation fails. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums.    Part size does not matchThe size of each part except the last must match the size specified in the corresponding InitiateMultipartUpload request. The size of the last part must be the same size as, or smaller than, the specified size.  If you upload a part whose size is smaller than the part size you specified in your initiate multipart upload request and that part is not the last part, then the upload part request will succeed. However, the subsequent Complete Multipart Upload request will fail.     Range does not alignThe byte range value in the request does not align with the part size specified in the corresponding initiate request. For example, if you specify a part size of 4194304 bytes (4 MB), then 0 to 4194303 bytes (4 MB - 1) and 4194304 (4 MB) to 8388607 (8 MB - 1) are valid part ranges. However, if you set a range value of 2 MB to 6 MB, the range does not align with the part size and the upload will fail.    This operation is idempotent.

Depending on the job type you specified when you initiated the job, the output will be either the content of an archive or a vault inventory.

In the case of an archive retrieval job, depending on the byte range you specify, Amazon S3 Glacier (Glacier) returns the checksum for the portion of the data.

For both archive and inventory retrieval jobs, you should verify the downloaded size against the size returned in the headers from the Get Job Output response. For archive retrieval jobs, you should also verify that the size is what you expected. If you download a portion of the output, the expected size is based on the range of bytes you specified. For example, if you specify a range of bytes=0-1048575, you should verify your download size is 1,048,576 bytes.
