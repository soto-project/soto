If Amazon Lex cannot infer the user intent from this utterance, it will return this dialog state.     ConfirmIntent - Amazon Lex is expecting a "yes" or "no" response.  For example, Amazon Lex wants user confirmation before fulfilling an intent. Instead of a simple "yes" or "no" response, a user might respond with additional information. For example, "yes, but make it a thick crust pizza" or "no, I want to order a drink." Amazon Lex can process such additional information (in these examples, update the crust type slot or change the intent from OrderPizza to OrderDrink).     ElicitSlot - Amazon Lex is expecting the value of a slot for the current intent.  For example, suppose that in the response Amazon Lex sends this message: "What size pizza would you like?".
