/// Service object for interacting with AWS CloudWatch service.
///
/// Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) resources and the applications you run on Amazon Web Services in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources and applications. CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically change the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, use this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money. In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with Amazon Web Services, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.

    /// Deletes the specified alarms. You can delete up to 100 alarms in one operation. However, this total can include no more than one composite alarm. For example, you could delete 99 metric alarms and one composite alarms with one operation, but you can't delete two composite alarms with one operation. If you specify an incorrect alarm name or make any other error in the operation, no alarms are deleted. To confirm that alarms were deleted successfully, you can use the DescribeAlarms operation after using DeleteAlarms.  It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete. To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a dependency that creates the cycle. The simplest change to make to break a cycle is to change the AlarmRule of one of the alarms to false.  Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch detects a cycle in the evaluation path.

For more information about metric math expressions, see Metric Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. If you include a Metrics Insights query, each GetMetricData operation can include only one query. But the same GetMetricData operation can also retrieve other metrics. Metrics Insights queries can query only the most recent three hours of metric data. For more information about Metrics Insights, see Query your metrics with CloudWatch Metrics Insights. Calls to the GetMetricData API have a different pricing structure than calls to GetMetricStatistics. For more information about pricing, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing. Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:   Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a StorageResolution of 1.   Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.   Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.   Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).   Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour. If you omit Unit in your request, all data that was collected with any unit is returned, along with the corresponding units that were specified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If you specify a unit, the operation returns only data that was collected with that unit specified. If you specify a unit that does not match the data collected, the results of the operation are null. CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.  Using Metrics Insights queries with metric math  You can't mix a Metric Insights query and metric math syntax in the same expression, but you can reference results from a Metrics Insights query within other Metric math expressions. A Metrics Insights query without a GROUP BY clause returns a single time-series (TS), and can be used as input for a metric math expression that expects a single time series. A Metrics Insights query with a GROUP BY clause returns an array of time-series (TS[]), and can be used as input for a metric math expression that expects an array of time series.

    ///   - startTime: The time stamp indicating the earliest data to be returned. The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp.  CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:   Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.   Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00.

If you set Period to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or 30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15.  For better performance, specify StartTime and EndTime values that align with the value of the metric's Period and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the Period of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as StartTime can get a faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the StartTime.

To reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase the specified period. Data points are not returned in chronological order. CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned. CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:   The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1.   The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.   Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers. Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:   Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3 hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available only for custom metrics that have been defined with a StorageResolution of 1.   Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for 15 days.   Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for 63 days.   Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for 455 days (15 months).   Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available, but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes. After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a resolution of 1 hour. CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of July 9, 2016.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - dimensions: The dimensions. If the metric contains multiple dimensions, you must include a value for each dimension. CloudWatch treats each unique combination of dimensions as a separate metric. If a specific combination of dimensions was not published, you can't retrieve statistics for it. You must specify the same dimensions that were used when the metrics were created. For an example, see Dimension Combinations in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide. For more information about specifying dimensions, see Publishing Metrics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.
    ///   - endTime: The time stamp that determines the last data point to return. The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to the specified time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-10T23:00:00Z).
    ///   - extendedStatistics: The percentile statistics. Specify values between p0.0 and p100. When calling GetMetricStatistics, you must specify either Statistics or ExtendedStatistics, but not both. Percentile statistics are not available for metrics when any of the metric values are negative numbers.
    ///   - metricName: The name of the metric, with or without spaces.
    ///   - namespace: The namespace of the metric, with or without spaces.
    ///   - period: The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. For metrics with regular resolution, a period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are collected at intervals of less than one minute, the period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by a PutMetricData call that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second. If the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:   Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).   Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).   Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).
    ///   - startTime: The time stamp that determines the first data point to return. Start times are evaluated relative to the time that CloudWatch receives the request. The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp. In a raw HTTP query, the time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-03T23:00:00Z). CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:   Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.   Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00.   Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00.

Using composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only for the composite alarm.

Composite alarms can take the following actions:   Notify Amazon SNS topics.   Invoke Lambda functions.   Create OpsItems in Systems Manager Ops Center.   Create incidents in Systems Manager Incident Manager.    It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms, where composite alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm B also depends on composite alarm A. In this scenario, you can't delete any composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there is always still a composite alarm that depends on that alarm that you want to delete.

    ///   - alarmDescription: The description for the composite alarm.
    ///   - alarmName: The name for the composite alarm. This name must be unique within the Region.
    ///   - alarmRule: An expression that specifies which other alarms are to be evaluated to determine this composite alarm's state. For each alarm that you reference, you designate a function that specifies whether that alarm needs to be in ALARM state, OK state, or INSUFFICIENT_DATA state. You can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple functions in a single expression. You can use parenthesis to logically group the functions in your expression. You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms that are to be evaluated. Functions can include the following:    ALARM("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in ALARM state.    OK("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in OK state.    INSUFFICIENT_DATA("alarm-name or alarm-ARN") is TRUE if the named alarm is in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.    TRUE always evaluates to TRUE.    FALSE always evaluates to FALSE.   TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex AlarmRule structure, and for testing your alarm actions. Alarm names specified in AlarmRule can be surrounded with double-quotes ("), but do not have to be. The following are some examples of AlarmRule:    ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh) specifies that the composite alarm goes into ALARM state only if both CPUUtilizationTooHigh and DiskReadOpsTooHigh alarms are in ALARM state.    ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND NOT ALARM(DeploymentInProgress) specifies that the alarm goes to ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh is in ALARM state and DeploymentInProgress is not in ALARM state. This example reduces alarm noise during a known deployment window.    (ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) OR ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh)) AND OK(NetworkOutTooHigh) goes into ALARM state if CPUUtilizationTooHigh OR DiskReadOpsTooHigh is in ALARM state, and if NetworkOutTooHigh is in OK state. This provides another example of using a composite alarm to prevent noise. This rule ensures that you are not notified with an alarm action on high CPU or disk usage if a known network problem is also occurring.   The AlarmRule can specify as many as 100 "children" alarms. The AlarmRule expression can have as many as 500 elements. Elements are child alarms, TRUE or FALSE statements, and parentheses.

To create a cross-account alarm that watches a metric in a different account, you must have completed the following pre-requisites:   The account where the metrics are located (the sharing account) must already have a sharing role named CloudWatch-CrossAccountSharingRole. If it does not already have this role, you must create it using the instructions in Set up a sharing account in  Cross-account cross-Region CloudWatch console. The policy for that role must grant access to the ID of the account where you are creating the alarm.    The account where you are creating the alarm (the monitoring account) must already have a service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchCrossAccount to allow CloudWatch to assume the sharing role in the sharing account. If it does not, you must create it following the directions in Set up a monitoring account in  Cross-account cross-Region CloudWatch console.

If you are creating an alarm based on a math expression, you cannot specify this parameter, or any of the Namespace, Dimensions, Period, Unit, Statistic, or ExtendedStatistic parameters. Instead, you specify all this information in the Metrics array.
    ///   - metrics: An array of MetricDataQuery structures that enable you to create an alarm based on the result of a metric math expression. For each PutMetricAlarm operation, you must specify either MetricName or a Metrics array. Each item in the Metrics array either retrieves a metric or performs a math expression. One item in the Metrics array is the expression that the alarm watches. You designate this expression by setting ReturnData to true for this object in the array. For more information, see MetricDataQuery. If you use the Metrics parameter, you cannot include the Namespace, MetricName, Dimensions, Period, Unit, Statistic, or ExtendedStatistic parameters of PutMetricAlarm in the same operation. Instead, you retrieve the metrics you are using in your math expression as part of the Metrics array.

    ///   - period: The length, in seconds, used each time the metric specified in MetricName is evaluated. Valid values are 10, 30, and any multiple of 60.  Period is required for alarms based on static thresholds. If you are creating an alarm based on a metric math expression, you specify the period for each metric within the objects in the Metrics array. Be sure to specify 10 or 30 only for metrics that are stored by a PutMetricData call with a StorageResolution of 1. If you specify a period of 10 or 30 for a metric that does not have sub-minute resolution, the alarm still attempts to gather data at the period rate that you specify. In this case, it does not receive data for the attempts that do not correspond to a one-minute data resolution, and the alarm might often lapse into INSUFFICENT_DATA status. Specifying 10 or 30 also sets this alarm as a high-resolution alarm, which has a higher charge than other alarms. For more information about pricing, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing. An alarm's total current evaluation period can be no longer than one day, so Period multiplied by EvaluationPeriods cannot be more than 86,400 seconds.
    ///   - statistic: The statistic for the metric specified in MetricName, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ExtendedStatistic. When you call PutMetricAlarm and specify a MetricName, you must specify either Statistic or ExtendedStatistic, but not both.
    ///   - tags: A list of key-value pairs to associate with the alarm. You can associate as many as 50 tags with an alarm. To be able to associate tags with the alarm when you create the alarm, you must have the cloudwatch:TagResource permission. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. If you are using this operation to update an existing alarm, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing alarm, use TagResource or UntagResource. To use this field to set tags for an alarm when you create it, you must be signed on with both the cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm and cloudwatch:TagResource permissions.
    ///   - threshold: The value against which the specified statistic is compared. This parameter is required for alarms based on static thresholds, but should not be used for alarms based on anomaly detection models.
    ///   - thresholdMetricId: If this is an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, make this value match the ID of the ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND function. For an example of how to use this parameter, see the Anomaly Detection Model Alarm example on this page. If your alarm uses this parameter, it cannot have Auto Scaling actions.
    ///   - treatMissingData:  Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. If TreatMissingData is omitted, the default behavior of missing is used. For more information, see Configuring How CloudWatch Alarms Treats Missing Data. Valid Values: breaching | notBreaching | ignore | missing   Alarms that evaluate metrics in the AWS/DynamoDB namespace always ignore missing data even if you choose a different option for TreatMissingData. When an AWS/DynamoDB metric has missing data, alarms that evaluate that metric remain in their current state.
    ///   - unit: The unit of measure for the statistic. For example, the units for the Amazon EC2 NetworkIn metric are Bytes because NetworkIn tracks the number of bytes that an instance receives on all network interfaces. You can also specify a unit when you create a custom metric. Units help provide conceptual meaning to your data. Metric data points that specify a unit of measure, such as Percent, are aggregated separately. If you are creating an alarm based on a metric math expression, you can specify the unit for each metric (if needed) within the objects in the Metrics array. If you don't specify Unit, CloudWatch retrieves all unit types that have been published for the metric and attempts to evaluate the alarm. Usually, metrics are published with only one unit, so the alarm works as intended. However, if the metric is published with multiple types of units and you don't specify a unit, the alarm's behavior is not defined and it behaves unpredictably. We recommend omitting Unit so that you don't inadvertently specify an incorrect unit that is not published for this metric. Doing so causes the alarm to be stuck in the INSUFFICIENT DATA state.

For more information, see  Using Metric Streams. To create a metric stream, you must be signed in to an account that has the iam:PassRole permission and either the CloudWatchFullAccess policy or the cloudwatch:PutMetricStream permission. When you create or update a metric stream, you choose one of the following:   Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account.   Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account, except for the namespaces that you list in ExcludeFilters.   Stream metrics from only the metric namespaces that you list in IncludeFilters.   By default, a metric stream always sends the MAX, MIN, SUM, and SAMPLECOUNT statistics for each metric that is streamed. You can use the StatisticsConfigurations parameter to have the metric stream send additional statistics in the stream. Streaming additional statistics incurs additional costs. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing.  When you use PutMetricStream to create a new metric stream, the stream is created in the running state. If you use it to update an existing stream, the state of the stream is not changed. If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability and you create a metric stream in a monitoring account, you can choose whether to include metrics from source accounts in the stream. For more information, see CloudWatch cross-account observability.

    /// Creates or updates a metric stream. Metric streams can automatically stream CloudWatch metrics to Amazon Web Services destinations, including Amazon S3, and to many third-party solutions. For more information, see  Using Metric Streams. To create a metric stream, you must be signed in to an account that has the iam:PassRole permission and either the CloudWatchFullAccess policy or the cloudwatch:PutMetricStream permission. When you create or update a metric stream, you choose one of the following:   Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account.   Stream metrics from all metric namespaces in the account, except for the namespaces that you list in ExcludeFilters.   Stream metrics from only the metric namespaces that you list in IncludeFilters.   By default, a metric stream always sends the MAX, MIN, SUM, and SAMPLECOUNT statistics for each metric that is streamed. You can use the StatisticsConfigurations parameter to have the metric stream send additional statistics in the stream. Streaming additional statistics incurs additional costs. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Pricing.  When you use PutMetricStream to create a new metric stream, the stream is created in the running state. If you use it to update an existing stream, the state of the stream is not changed. If you are using CloudWatch cross-account observability and you create a metric stream in a monitoring account, you can choose whether to include metrics from source accounts in the stream. For more information, see CloudWatch cross-account observability.
    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - excludeFilters: If you specify this parameter, the stream sends metrics from all metric namespaces except for the namespaces that you specify here. You cannot include ExcludeFilters and IncludeFilters in the same operation.
    ///   - firehoseArn: The ARN of the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to use for this metric stream. This Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream must already exist and must be in the same account as the metric stream.
    ///   - includeFilters: If you specify this parameter, the stream sends only the metrics from the metric namespaces that you specify here. You cannot include IncludeFilters and ExcludeFilters in the same operation.
    ///   - includeLinkedAccountsMetrics: If you are creating a metric stream in a monitoring account, specify true to include metrics from source accounts in the metric stream.
    ///   - name: If you are creating a new metric stream, this is the name for the new stream. The name must be different than the names of other metric streams in this account and Region. If you are updating a metric stream, specify the name of that stream here. Valid characters are A-Z, a-z, 0-9, "-" and "_".
    ///   - outputFormat: The output format for the stream. Valid values are json, opentelemetry1.0, and opentelemetry0.7. For more information about metric stream output formats, see  Metric streams output formats.
    ///   - roleArn: The ARN of an IAM role that this metric stream will use to access Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose resources. This IAM role must already exist and must be in the same account as the metric stream. This IAM role must include the following permissions:   firehose:PutRecord   firehose:PutRecordBatch
    ///   - statisticsConfigurations: By default, a metric stream always sends the MAX, MIN, SUM, and SAMPLECOUNT statistics for each metric that is streamed. You can use this parameter to have the metric stream also send additional statistics in the stream. This array can have up to 100 members. For each entry in this array, you specify one or more metrics and the list of additional statistics to stream for those metrics. The additional statistics that you can stream depend on the stream's OutputFormat. If the OutputFormat is json, you can stream any additional statistic that is supported by CloudWatch, listed in  CloudWatch statistics definitions. If the OutputFormat is opentelemetry1.0 or opentelemetry0.7, you can stream percentile statistics such as p95, p99.9, and so on.
    ///   - tags: A list of key-value pairs to associate with the metric stream. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a metric stream. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. You can use this parameter only when you are creating a new metric stream. If you are using this operation to update an existing metric stream, any tags you specify in this parameter are ignored. To change the tags of an existing metric stream, use TagResource or UntagResource.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - endTime: The time stamp indicating the latest data to be returned. The value specified is exclusive; results include data points up to the specified time stamp. For better performance, specify StartTime and EndTime values that align with the value of the metric's Period and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the Period of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as EndTime can get a faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the EndTime.
    ///   - labelOptions: This structure includes the Timezone parameter, which you can use to specify your time zone so that the labels of returned data display the correct time for your time zone.
    ///   - maxDatapoints: The maximum number of data points the request should return before paginating. If you omit this, the default of 100,800 is used.
    ///   - metricDataQueries: The metric queries to be returned. A single GetMetricData call can include as many as 500 MetricDataQuery structures. Each of these structures can specify either a metric to retrieve, a Metrics Insights query, or a math expression to perform on retrieved data.
    ///   - scanBy: The order in which data points should be returned. TimestampDescending returns the newest data first and paginates when the MaxDatapoints limit is reached. TimestampAscending returns the oldest data first and paginates when the MaxDatapoints limit is reached. If you omit this parameter, the default of TimestampDescending is used.
    ///   - startTime: The time stamp indicating the earliest data to be returned. The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp.  CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:   Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.   Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00.   Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00.   If you set Period to 5, 10, or 30, the start time of your request is rounded down to the nearest time that corresponds to even 5-, 10-, or 30-second divisions of a minute. For example, if you make a query at (HH:mm:ss) 01:05:23 for the previous 10-second period, the start time of your request is rounded down and you receive data from 01:05:10 to 01:05:20. If you make a query at 15:07:17 for the previous 5 minutes of data, using a period of 5 seconds, you receive data timestamped between 15:02:15 and 15:07:15.  For better performance, specify StartTime and EndTime values that align with the value of the metric's Period and sync up with the beginning and end of an hour. For example, if the Period of a metric is 5 minutes, specifying 12:05 or 12:30 as StartTime can get a faster response from CloudWatch than setting 12:07 or 12:29 as the StartTime.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - actionPrefix: Use this parameter to filter the results of the operation to only those alarms that use a certain alarm action. For example, you could specify the ARN of an SNS topic to find all alarms that send notifications to that topic.
    ///   - alarmNamePrefix: An alarm name prefix. If you specify this parameter, you receive information about all alarms that have names that start with this prefix. If this parameter is specified, you cannot specify AlarmNames.
    ///   - alarmNames: The names of the alarms to retrieve information about.
    ///   - alarmTypes: Use this parameter to specify whether you want the operation to return metric alarms or composite alarms. If you omit this parameter, only metric alarms are returned, even if composite alarms exist in the account. For example, if you omit this parameter or specify MetricAlarms, the operation returns only a list of metric alarms. It does not return any composite alarms, even if composite alarms exist in the account. If you specify CompositeAlarms, the operation returns only a list of composite alarms, and does not return any metric alarms.
    ///   - childrenOfAlarmName: If you use this parameter and specify the name of a composite alarm, the operation returns information about the "children" alarms of the alarm you specify. These are the metric alarms and composite alarms referenced in the AlarmRule field of the composite alarm that you specify in ChildrenOfAlarmName. Information about the composite alarm that you name in ChildrenOfAlarmName is not returned. If you specify ChildrenOfAlarmName, you cannot specify any other parameters in the request except for MaxRecords and NextToken. If you do so, you receive a validation error.  Only the Alarm Name, ARN, StateValue (OK/ALARM/INSUFFICIENT_DATA), and StateUpdatedTimestamp information are returned by this operation when you use this parameter. To get complete information about these alarms, perform another DescribeAlarms operation and specify the parent alarm names in the AlarmNames parameter.
    ///   - maxRecords: The maximum number of alarm descriptions to retrieve.
    ///   - nextToken: The token returned by a previous call to indicate that there is more data available.
    ///   - parentsOfAlarmName: If you use this parameter and specify the name of a metric or composite alarm, the operation returns information about the "parent" alarms of the alarm you specify. These are the composite alarms that have AlarmRule parameters that reference the alarm named in ParentsOfAlarmName. Information about the alarm that you specify in ParentsOfAlarmName is not returned. If you specify ParentsOfAlarmName, you cannot specify any other parameters in the request except for MaxRecords and NextToken. If you do so, you receive a validation error.  Only the Alarm Name and ARN are returned by this operation when you use this parameter. To get complete information about these alarms, perform another DescribeAlarms operation and specify the parent alarm names in the AlarmNames parameter.
    ///   - stateValue: Specify this parameter to receive information only about alarms that are currently in the state that you specify.
