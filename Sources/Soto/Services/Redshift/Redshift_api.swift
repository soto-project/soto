/// Service object for interacting with AWS Redshift service.
///
/// Amazon Redshift  Overview  This is an interface reference for Amazon Redshift. It contains documentation for one of the programming or command line interfaces you can use to manage Amazon Redshift clusters. Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster management interfaces, go to Using the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces. Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers. If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide. If you are a database developer, the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that make up your data warehouse.

    ///   - clusterSecurityGroups: A list of cluster security groups to be authorized on this cluster. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Security groups currently associated with the cluster, and not in the list of groups to apply, will be revoked from the cluster. Constraints:   Must be 1 to 255 alphanumeric characters or hyphens   First character must be a letter   Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens
    ///   - clusterType: The new cluster type. When you submit your cluster resize request, your existing cluster goes into a read-only mode. After Amazon Redshift provisions a new cluster based on your resize requirements, there will be outage for a period while the old cluster is deleted and your connection is switched to the new cluster. You can use DescribeResize to track the progress of the resize request.  Valid Values:  multi-node | single-node
    ///   - clusterVersion: The new version number of the Amazon Redshift engine to upgrade to. For major version upgrades, if a non-default cluster parameter group is currently in use, a new cluster parameter group in the cluster parameter group family for the new version must be specified. The new cluster parameter group can be the default for that cluster parameter group family.
    ///   - elasticIp: The Elastic IP (EIP) address for the cluster. Constraints: The cluster must be provisioned in EC2-VPC and publicly-accessible through an Internet gateway. For more information about provisioning clusters in EC2-VPC, go to Supported Platforms to Launch Your Cluster in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide.
    ///   - encrypted: Indicates whether the cluster is encrypted. If the value is encrypted (true) and you provide a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, we encrypt the cluster with the provided KmsKeyId. If you don't provide a KmsKeyId, we encrypt with the default key.  If the value is not encrypted (false), then the cluster is decrypted.
    ///   - enhancedVpcRouting: An option that specifies whether to create the cluster with enhanced VPC routing enabled. To create a cluster that uses enhanced VPC routing, the cluster must be in a VPC. For more information, see Enhanced VPC Routing in the Amazon Redshift Cluster Management Guide. If this option is true, enhanced VPC routing is enabled.  Default: false

    ///   - masterPasswordSecretKmsKeyId: The ID of the Key Management Service (KMS) key used to encrypt and store the cluster's admin credentials secret.  You can only use this parameter if ManageMasterPassword is true.
    ///   - masterUserPassword: The new password for the cluster admin user. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. Between the time of the request and the completion of the request, the MasterUserPassword element exists in the PendingModifiedValues element of the operation response.  You can't use MasterUserPassword if ManageMasterPassword is true.  Operations never return the password, so this operation provides a way to regain access to the admin user account for a cluster if the password is lost.  Default: Uses existing setting. Constraints:   Must be between 8 and 64 characters in length.   Must contain at least one uppercase letter.   Must contain at least one lowercase letter.   Must contain one number.

    ///   - snapshotArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the snapshot associated with the message to describe cluster snapshots.
    ///   - snapshotIdentifier: The snapshot identifier of the snapshot about which to return information.
    ///   - snapshotType: The type of snapshots for which you are requesting information. By default, snapshots of all types are returned. Valid Values: automated | manual

    ///   - startTime: A value that requests only snapshots created at or after the specified time. The time value is specified in ISO 8601 format. For more information about ISO 8601, go to the ISO8601 Wikipedia page.  Example: 2012-07-16T18:00:00Z
    ///   - tagKeys: A tag key or keys for which you want to return all matching cluster snapshots that are associated with the specified key or keys. For example, suppose that you have snapshots that are tagged with keys called owner and environment. If you specify both of these tag keys in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the snapshots that have either or both of these tag keys associated with them.
    ///   - tagValues: A tag value or values for which you want to return all matching cluster snapshots that are associated with the specified tag value or values. For example, suppose that you have snapshots that are tagged with values called admin and test. If you specify both of these tag values in the request, Amazon Redshift returns a response with the snapshots that have either or both of these tag values associated with them.
