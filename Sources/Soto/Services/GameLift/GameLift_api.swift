    // MARK: API Calls

    /// Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.  When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in each ticket. Calls to this action are only valid for tickets that are in this status; calls for tickets not in this status result in an error. To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, one or more players, and an acceptance response. When all players have accepted, Amazon GameLift advances the matchmaking tickets to status PLACING, and attempts to create a new game session for the match.  If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. Each matchmaking ticket in the failed match is handled as follows:    If the ticket has one or more players who rejected the match or failed to respond, the ticket status is set CANCELLED and processing is terminated.   If all players in the ticket accepted the match, the ticket status is returned to SEARCHING to find a new match.     Learn more    Add FlexMatch to a game client    FlexMatch events (reference)

    /// Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build.  Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site.  To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling UpdateAlias.  Related actions   All APIs by task

    /// Creates a managed fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to host your containerized game servers. Use this operation to define how to deploy a container architecture onto each fleet instance and configure fleet settings. You can create a container fleet in any Amazon Web Services Regions that Amazon GameLift supports for multi-location fleets. A container fleet can be deployed to a single location or multiple locations. Container fleets are deployed with Amazon Linux 2023 as the instance operating system. Define the fleet's container architecture using container group definitions. Each fleet can have one of the following container group types:   The game server container group runs your game server build and dependent software. Amazon GameLift deploys one or more replicas of this container group to each fleet instance. The number of replicas depends on the computing capabilities of the fleet instance in use.    An optional per-instance container group might be used to run other software that only needs to run once per instance, such as background services, logging, or test processes. One per-instance container group is deployed to each fleet instance.    Each container group can include the definition for one or more containers. A container definition specifies a container image that is stored in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) public or private repository.  Request options  Use this operation to make the following types of requests. Most fleet settings have default values, so you can create a working fleet with a minimal configuration and default values, which you can customize later.   Create a fleet with no container groups. You can configure a container fleet and then add container group definitions later. In this scenario, no fleet instances are deployed, and the fleet can't host game sessions until you add a game server container group definition.

Provide the following required parameter values:    FleetRoleArn     GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName     PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName       Results  If successful, this operation creates a new container fleet resource, places it in PENDING status, and initiates the fleet creation workflow. For fleets with container groups, this workflow starts a fleet deployment and transitions the status to ACTIVE. Fleets without a container group are placed in CREATED status. You can update most of the properties of a fleet, including container group definitions, and deploy the update across all fleet instances. Use a fleet update to deploy a new game server version update across the container fleet.

One per-instance container group is deployed to each fleet instance.    Each container group can include the definition for one or more containers. A container definition specifies a container image that is stored in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) public or private repository.  Request options  Use this operation to make the following types of requests. Most fleet settings have default values, so you can create a working fleet with a minimal configuration and default values, which you can customize later.   Create a fleet with no container groups. You can configure a container fleet and then add container group definitions later. In this scenario, no fleet instances are deployed, and the fleet can't host game sessions until you add a game server container group definition. Provide the following required parameter values:    FleetRoleArn      Create a fleet with a game server container group. Provide the following required parameter values:    FleetRoleArn     GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName      Create a fleet with a game server container group and a per-instance container group. Provide the following required parameter values:    FleetRoleArn     GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName     PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName       Results  If successful, this operation creates a new container fleet resource, places it in PENDING status, and initiates the fleet creation workflow. For fleets with container groups, this workflow starts a fleet deployment and transitions the status to ACTIVE. Fleets without a container group are placed in CREATED status. You can update most of the properties of a fleet, including container group definitions, and deploy the update across all fleet instances. Use a fleet update to deploy a new game server version update across the container fleet.

    ///   - newGameSessionProtectionPolicy: Determines whether Amazon GameLift can shut down game sessions on the fleet that are actively running and hosting players. Amazon GameLift might prompt an instance shutdown when scaling down fleet capacity or when retiring unhealthy instances. You can also set game session protection for individual game sessions using UpdateGameSession.    NoProtection -- Game sessions can be shut down during active gameplay.     FullProtection -- Game sessions in ACTIVE status can't be shut down.   By default, this property is set to NoProtection.
    ///   - perInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName: The name of a container group definition resource that describes a set of axillary software. A fleet instance has one process for executables in this container group. A per-instance container group is optional. You can update the fleet to add or remove a per-instance container group at any time. You can specify the container group definition's name to use the latest version. Alternatively, provide an ARN value with a specific version number.  Create a container group definition by calling  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_CreateContainerGroupDefinition.html.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - autoScalingPolicy: Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group that is optimized for game hosting. The scaling policy uses the metric "PercentUtilizedGameServers" to maintain a buffer of idle game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and players. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.
    ///   - balancingStrategy: Indicates how Amazon GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:    SPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.    SPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.    ON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.
    ///   - gameServerGroupName: An identifier for the new game server group. This value is used to generate unique ARN identifiers for the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ game server group. The name must be unique per Region per Amazon Web Services account.
    ///   - gameServerProtectionPolicy: A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected  from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might  be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game.  Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except  in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot  Instances, which can be terminated by Amazon Web Services regardless of protection status. This property is set to NO_PROTECTION by default.
    ///   - instanceDefinitions: The Amazon EC2 instance types and sizes to use in the Auto Scaling group. The instance definitions must specify at least two different instance types that are supported by Amazon GameLift FleetIQ. For more information on instance types, see EC2 Instance Types in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. You can optionally specify capacity weighting for each instance type. If no weight value is specified for an instance type, it is set to the default value "1". For more information about capacity weighting, see Instance Weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - launchTemplate: The Amazon EC2 launch template that contains configuration settings and game server code to be deployed to all instances in the game server group. You can specify the template using either the template name or ID. For help with creating a launch template, see Creating a Launch Template for an Auto Scaling Group in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Auto Scaling User Guide. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.  If you specify network interfaces in your launch template, you must explicitly set the property AssociatePublicIpAddress to "true". If no network interface is specified in the launch template, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ uses your account's default VPC.
    ///   - maxSize: The maximum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale up the group above this maximum. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.
    ///   - minSize: The minimum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ and Amazon EC2 do not scale down the group below this minimum. In production, this value should be set to at least 1. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.
    ///   - roleArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

A queue uses FleetIQ algorithms to locate the best available placement locations for a new game session, and then prompts the game server process to start a new game session. A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (Amazon GameLift fleets or aliases) that determine where the queue can place new game sessions. These destinations can span multiple Amazon Web Services Regions, can use different instance types, and can include both Spot and On-Demand fleets. If the queue includes multi-location fleets, the queue can place game sessions in any of a fleet's remote locations.

    /// Creates a new script record for your Amazon GameLift Realtime script. Realtime scripts are JavaScript that provide configuration settings and optional custom game logic for your game. The script is deployed when you create a Amazon GameLift Realtime fleet to host your game sessions. Script logic is executed during an active game session.  To create a new script record, specify a script name and provide the script file(s). The script files and all dependencies must be zipped into a single file. You can pull the zip file from either of these locations:    A locally available directory. Use the ZipFile parameter for this option.   An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your Amazon Web Services account. Use the StorageLocation parameter for this option. You'll need to have an Identity Access Management (IAM) role that allows the Amazon GameLift service to access your S3 bucket.    If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a unique script ID. If the script file is provided as a local file, the file is uploaded to an Amazon GameLift-owned S3 bucket and the script record's storage location reflects this location. If the script file is provided as an S3 bucket, Amazon GameLift accesses the file at this storage location as needed for deployment.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - name: A descriptive label that is associated with a script. Script names do not need to be unique. You can use UpdateScript to change this value later.
    ///   - storageLocation: The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file containing your Realtime scripts is stored. The storage location must specify the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the Amazon S3 storage location. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to create a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the latest version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the ObjectVersion parameter to specify an earlier version.
    ///   - tags: A list of labels to assign to the new script resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web Services resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see  Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. Once the resource is created, you can use TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the Amazon Web Services General Reference for actual tagging limits.
    ///   - version: Version information that is associated with a build or script. Version strings do not need to be unique. You can use UpdateScript to change this value later.
    ///   - zipFile: A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a zip file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size of a zip file is 5 MB. When using the Amazon Web Services CLI tool to create a script, this parameter is set to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the string "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a binary object. For example: --zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip.

    /// Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.  Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences. Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling.  Target-based policy  A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.  For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer.  To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.  Rule-based policy  A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.  For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%." A policy's rule statement has the following structure: If [MetricName] is [ComparisonOperator] [Threshold] for [EvaluationPeriods] minutes, then [ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment]. To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this: If [PercentIdleInstances] is [GreaterThanThreshold] [20] for [15] minutes, then [PercentChangeInCapacity] to/by [10]. To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

When searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to search and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all of a fleet's locations.  This operation can be used in the following ways:    To search all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach returns game sessions in the fleet's home Region and all remote locations that fit the search criteria.   To search all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name. For location, you can specify a fleet's home Region or any remote location.   Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.  If successful, a GameSession object is returned for each game session that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in ACTIVE status only. To retrieve information on game sessions in other statuses, use DescribeGameSessions. To set search and sort criteria, create a filter expression using the following game session attributes.

You can use either a GameSessionId or GameSessionArn value.     gameSessionName -- Name assigned to a game session. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.    gameSessionProperties -- A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: {"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}. The filter expression must specify the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/apireference/API_GameProperty -- a Key and a string Value to search for the game sessions. For example, to search for the above key-value pair, specify the following search filter: gameSessionProperties.difficulty = "novice". All game property values are searched as strings.  For examples of searching game sessions, see the ones below, and also see Search game sessions by game property.     maximumSessions -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session.    creationTimeMillis -- Value indicating when a game session was created.

    ///   - filterExpression: String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in ACTIVE status. A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists of the following:    Operand -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are gameSessionName, gameSessionId, gameSessionProperties, maximumSessions, creationTimeMillis, playerSessionCount, hasAvailablePlayerSessions.    Comparator -- Valid comparators are: =, <>, , >, , >=.     Value -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators = and <>. For example, the following filter expression searches on gameSessionName: "FilterExpression": "gameSessionName = 'Matt\\'s Awesome Game 1'".    To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords AND, OR, and NOT and parentheses as needed. For example: x AND y AND NOT z, NOT (x OR y). Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:    =, <>, , >, , >=    Parentheses   NOT   AND   OR   For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: "maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true".

After selecting an available resource, Amazon GameLift prompts the resource to start a game session. A placement request can include a list of players to create a set of player sessions. The request can also include information to pass to the new game session, such as to specify a game map or other options.  Request options  Use this operation to make the following types of requests.    Request a placement using the queue's default prioritization process (see the default prioritization described in PriorityConfiguration). Include these required parameters:    GameSessionQueueName     MaximumPlayerSessionCount     PlacementID      Request a placement and prioritize based on latency. Include these parameters:   Required parameters GameSessionQueueName, MaximumPlayerSessionCount, PlacementID.    PlayerLatencies. Include a set of latency values for destinations in the queue. When a request includes latency data, Amazon GameLift automatically reorder the queue's locations priority list based on lowest available latency values. If a request includes latency data for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each location's average latency for all players and reorders to find the lowest latency across all players.   Don't include PriorityConfigurationOverride.     Prioritize based on a custom list of locations. If you're using a queue that's configured to prioritize location first (see PriorityConfiguration for game session queues), you can optionally use the PriorityConfigurationOverride parameter to substitute a different location priority list for this placement request. Amazon GameLift searches each location on the priority override list to find an available hosting resource for the new game session. Specify a fallback strategy to use in the event that Amazon GameLift fails to place the game session in any of the locations on the override list.      Request a placement and prioritized based on a custom list of locations.    You can request new player sessions for a group of players. Include the DesiredPlayerSessions parameter and include at minimum a unique player ID for each. You can also include player-specific data to pass to the new game session.     Result  If successful, this operation generates a new game session placement request and adds it to the game session queue for processing. You can track the status of individual placement requests by calling DescribeGameSessionPlacement or by monitoring queue notifications. When the request status is FULFILLED, a new game session has started and the placement request is updated with connection information for the game session (IP address and port).

The request results in a InvalidRequestException in the following situations:   If the request includes both PlayerLatencies and PriorityConfigurationOverride parameters.   If the request includes the PriorityConfigurationOverride parameter and specifies a queue that doesn't prioritize locations.

Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements.  When using FlexMatch with Amazon GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a GameSessions ID. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the GameSession resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request. When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled. To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the GameSession ARN. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches. Only game sessions created by FlexMatch are supported for match backfill.

Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session.

When using FlexMatch with Amazon GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a GameSessions ID. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server.

Fleet capacity determines the number of game sessions and players that the fleet can host based on its configuration. For fleets with multiple locations, use this operation to manage capacity settings in each location individually. Use this operation to set these fleet capacity properties:    Minimum/maximum size: Set hard limits on the number of Amazon EC2 instances allowed. If Amazon GameLift receives a  request--either through manual update or automatic scaling--it won't change the capacity  to a value outside of this range.   Desired capacity: As an alternative to automatic scaling, manually set the number of Amazon EC2  instances to be maintained.  Before changing a fleet's desired capacity, check the maximum capacity of the fleet's Amazon EC2 instance type by calling DescribeEC2InstanceLimits.   To update capacity for a fleet's home Region, or if the fleet has no remote locations, omit the Location parameter. The fleet must be in ACTIVE status.

If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in ACTIVE status. A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions.

Valid values are gameSessionName, gameSessionId, gameSessionProperties, maximumSessions, creationTimeMillis, playerSessionCount, hasAvailablePlayerSessions.    Comparator -- Valid comparators are: =, <>, , >, , >=.     Value -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators = and <>. For example, the following filter expression searches on gameSessionName: "FilterExpression": "gameSessionName = 'Matt\\'s Awesome Game 1'".    To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords AND, OR, and NOT and parentheses as needed. For example: x AND y AND NOT z, NOT (x OR y). Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:    =, <>, , >, , >=    Parentheses   NOT   AND   OR   For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: "maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true".

    ///   - sortExpression: Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression is included, the request returns results in random order. A sort expression consists of the following elements:    Operand -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are gameSessionName, gameSessionId, gameSessionProperties, maximumSessions, creationTimeMillis, playerSessionCount, hasAvailablePlayerSessions.
