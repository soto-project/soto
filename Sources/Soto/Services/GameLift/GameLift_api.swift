    // MARK: API Calls

    /// Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.  When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in each ticket. Calls to this action are only valid for tickets that are in this status; calls for tickets not in this status result in an error. To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, one or more players, and an acceptance response. When all players have accepted, Amazon GameLift advances the matchmaking tickets to status PLACING, and attempts to create a new game session for the match.  If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. Each matchmaking ticket in the failed match is handled as follows:    If the ticket has one or more players who rejected the match or failed to respond, the ticket status is set CANCELLED and processing is terminated.   If all players in the ticket accepted the match, the ticket status is returned to SEARCHING to find a new match.     Learn more    Add FlexMatch to a game client    FlexMatch events (reference)

    ///  This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.  Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players. This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in CLAIMED status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server.  To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses Amazon GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information. Add filter options to further restrict how a game server is chosen, such as only allowing game servers on ACTIVE instances to be claimed. When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains AVAILABLE while the claim status is set to CLAIMED for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to UTILIZED after players join. If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable. If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following cases:   If the game server utilization status is UTILIZED.   If the game server claim status is CLAIMED.   If the game server is running on an instance in DRAINING status and the provided filter option does not allow placing on DRAINING instances.    Learn more   Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Guide

    /// Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build.  Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site.  To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling UpdateAlias.  Related actions   All APIs by task

    /// Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary files. Combine game server binaries into a zip file for use with Amazon GameLift.   When setting up a new game build for Amazon GameLift, we recommend using the CLI command  upload-build . This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build files from a file directory to an Amazon GameLift Amazon S3 location, and (2) it creates a new build resource.  You can use the CreateBuild operation in the following scenarios:   Create a new game build with build files that are in an Amazon S3 location under an Amazon Web Services account that you control. To use this option, you give Amazon GameLift access to the Amazon S3 bucket. With permissions in place, specify a build name, operating system, and the Amazon S3 storage location of your game build.   Upload your build files to a Amazon GameLift Amazon S3 location. To use this option, specify a build name and operating system. This operation creates a new build resource and also returns an Amazon S3 location with temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build files to the specified Amazon S3 location. For more information, see Uploading Objects in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide. After you upload build files to the Amazon GameLift Amazon S3 location, you can't update them.    If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique build ID and places it in INITIALIZED status. A build must be in READY status before you can create fleets with it.

    /// Creates a fleet of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to host your custom game server or Realtime Servers. Use this operation to configure the computing resources for your fleet and provide instructions for running game servers on each instance. Most Amazon GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations, including the home Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional set of remote locations. Fleets that are created in the following Amazon Web Services Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1 (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1 (Ireland), ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets that are created in other Amazon GameLift Regions can deploy instances in the fleet's home Region only. All fleet instances use the same configuration regardless of location; however, you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each location. To create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a game server build or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime configuration to direct Amazon GameLift how to start and run game servers on each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for inbound traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When creating a multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations. If you need to debug your fleet, fetch logs, view performance metrics or other actions on the fleet, create the development fleet with port 22/3389 open. As a best practice, we recommend opening ports for remote access only when you need them and closing them when you're finished.  If successful, this operation creates a new Fleet resource and places it in NEW status, which prompts Amazon GameLift to initiate the fleet creation workflow. You can track fleet creation by checking fleet status using DescribeFleetAttributes and DescribeFleetLocationAttributes/, or by monitoring fleet creation events using DescribeFleetEvents.  When the fleet status changes to ACTIVE, you can enable automatic scaling with PutScalingPolicy and set capacity for the home Region with UpdateFleetCapacity. When the status of each remote location reaches ACTIVE, you can set capacity by location using UpdateFleetCapacity.

Creates a Amazon GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your Amazon Web Services account, and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of your game server groups in the Amazon GameLift console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch. Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:    An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances with your game server build. For more information, see  Launching an Instance from a Launch Template in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide.    An IAM role that extends limited access to your Amazon Web Services account to allow Amazon GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see Create IAM roles for cross-service interaction in the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide.   To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud launch template, and provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a Amazon GameLift FleetIQ metric. Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by Amazon GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.

    /// Creates a multiplayer game session for players in a specific fleet location. This operation prompts an available server process to start a game session and retrieves connection information for the new game session. As an alternative, consider using the Amazon GameLift game session placement feature with StartGameSessionPlacement , which uses the FleetIQ algorithm and queues to optimize the placement process. When creating a game session, you specify exactly where you want to place it and provide a set of game session configuration settings. The target fleet must be in ACTIVE status.  You can use this operation in the following ways:    To create a game session on an instance in a fleet's home Region, provide a fleet or alias ID along with your game session configuration.    To create a game session on an instance in a fleet's remote location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name, along with your game session configuration.    To create a game session on an instance in an Anywhere fleet, specify the fleet's custom location.   If successful, Amazon GameLift initiates a workflow to start a new game session and returns a GameSession object containing the game session configuration and status. When the game session status is ACTIVE, it is updated with connection information and you can create player sessions for the game session. By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players. You can restrict new player access by using UpdateGameSession to change the game session's player session creation policy.

    /// Creates a placement queue that processes requests for new game sessions. A queue uses FleetIQ algorithms to determine the best placement locations and find an available game server there, then prompts the game server process to start a new game session.  A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (Amazon GameLift fleets or aliases), which determine the locations where the queue can place new game sessions. These destinations can span multiple fleet types (Spot and On-Demand), instance types, and Amazon Web Services Regions. If the queue includes multi-location fleets, the queue is able to place game sessions in all of a fleet's remote locations. You can opt to filter out individual locations if needed. The queue configuration also determines how FleetIQ selects the best available placement for a new game session. Before searching for an available game server, FleetIQ first prioritizes the queue's destinations and locations, with the best placement locations on top. You can set up the queue to use the FleetIQ default prioritization or provide an alternate set of priorities. To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, and a list of destinations. Optionally, specify a sort configuration and/or a filter, and define a set of latency cap policies. You can also include the ARN for an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to receive notifications of game session placement activity. Notifications using SNS or CloudWatch events is the preferred way to track placement activity. If successful, a new GameSessionQueue object is returned with an assigned queue ARN. New game session requests, which are submitted to queue with StartGameSessionPlacement or StartMatchmaking, reference a queue's name or ARN.

The script is deployed when you create a Realtime Servers fleet to host your game sessions. Script logic is executed during an active game session.  To create a new script record, specify a script name and provide the script file(s). The script files and all dependencies must be zipped into a single file. You can pull the zip file from either of these locations:    A locally available directory. Use the ZipFile parameter for this option.   An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your Amazon Web Services account. Use the StorageLocation parameter for this option. You'll need to have an Identity Access Management (IAM) role that allows the Amazon GameLift service to access your S3 bucket.    If the call is successful, a new script record is created with a unique script ID. If the script file is provided as a local file, the file is uploaded to an Amazon GameLift-owned S3 bucket and the script record's storage location reflects this location.

    /// Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.  Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences. Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling.  Target-based policy  A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.  For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer.  To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.  Rule-based policy  A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.  For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%." A policy's rule statement has the following structure: If [MetricName] is [ComparisonOperator] [Threshold] for [EvaluationPeriods] minutes, then [ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment]. To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this: If [PercentIdleInstances] is [GreaterThanThreshold] [20] for [15] minutes, then [PercentChangeInCapacity] to/by [10]. To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

When searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to search and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all of a fleet's locations.  This operation can be used in the following ways:    To search all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach returns game sessions in the fleet's home Region and all remote locations that fit the search criteria.   To search all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name. For location, you can specify a fleet's home Region or any remote location.   Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.  If successful, a GameSession object is returned for each game session that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in ACTIVE status only. To retrieve information on game sessions in other statuses, use DescribeGameSessions . To set search and sort criteria, create a filter expression using the following game session attributes. For game session search examples, see the Examples section of this topic.    gameSessionId -- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a GameSessionId or GameSessionArn value.     gameSessionName -- Name assigned to a game session. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.    gameSessionProperties -- A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: {"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}. The filter expression must specify the GameProperty -- a Key and a string Value to search for the game sessions. For example, to search for the above key-value pair, specify the following search filter: gameSessionProperties.difficulty = "novice". All game property values are searched as strings.  For examples of searching game sessions, see the ones below, and also see Search game sessions by game property.     maximumSessions -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session.    creationTimeMillis -- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.    playerSessionCount -- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.    hasAvailablePlayerSessions -- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join.     Returned values for playerSessionCount and hasAvailablePlayerSessions change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time.

When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order. Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players.  To place a new game session request, specify the following:   The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings   A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the placement request   (Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for each player)   Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players)   If successful, a new game session placement is created. To track the status of a placement request, call DescribeGameSessionPlacement and check the request's status. If the status is FULFILLED, a new game session has been created and a game session ARN and Region are referenced. If the placement request times out, you can resubmit the request or retry it with a different queue.

    /// Finds new players to fill open slots in currently running game sessions. The backfill match process is essentially identical to the process of forming new matches. Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements.  When using FlexMatch with Amazon GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a GameSessions ID. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the GameSession resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request. When using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled. To request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the GameSession ARN. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of backfill tickets using the same method for tracking tickets for new matches. Only game sessions created by FlexMatch are supported for match backfill.

    /// Retrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria and sorts them into a specified order.  This operation is not designed to continually track game session status because that practice can cause you to exceed your API limit and generate errors. Instead, configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive notifications from a matchmaker or game session placement queue. When searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to search and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all of a fleet's locations.  This operation can be used in the following ways:    To search all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach returns game sessions in the fleet's home Region and all remote locations that fit the search criteria.   To search all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name. For location, you can specify a fleet's home Region or any remote location.   Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.  If successful, a GameSession object is returned for each game session that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in ACTIVE status only. To retrieve information on game sessions in other statuses, use DescribeGameSessions . To set search and sort criteria, create a filter expression using the following game session attributes. For game session search examples, see the Examples section of this topic.    gameSessionId -- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a GameSessionId or GameSessionArn value.     gameSessionName -- Name assigned to a game session. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.    gameSessionProperties -- A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: {"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}. The filter expression must specify the GameProperty -- a Key and a string Value to search for the game sessions. For example, to search for the above key-value pair, specify the following search filter: gameSessionProperties.difficulty = "novice". All game property values are searched as strings.  For examples of searching game sessions, see the ones below, and also see Search game sessions by game property.     maximumSessions -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session.    creationTimeMillis -- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.    playerSessionCount -- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.    hasAvailablePlayerSessions -- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join.     Returned values for playerSessionCount and hasAvailablePlayerSessions change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to refresh search results often, and handle sessions that fill up before a player can join.    All APIs by task
