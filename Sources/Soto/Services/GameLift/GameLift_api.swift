    // MARK: API Calls

    /// Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.  When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in each ticket. Calls to this action are only valid for tickets that are in this status; calls for tickets not in this status result in an error. To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, one or more players, and an acceptance response. When all players have accepted, Amazon GameLift advances the matchmaking tickets to status PLACING, and attempts to create a new game session for the match.  If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. Each matchmaking ticket in the failed match is handled as follows:    If the ticket has one or more players who rejected the match or failed to respond, the ticket status is set CANCELLED and processing is terminated.   If all players in the ticket accepted the match, the ticket status is returned to SEARCHING to find a new match.     Learn more    Add FlexMatch to a game client    FlexMatch events (reference)

In response, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in CLAIMED status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server.  To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses Amazon GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization.

Add filter options to further restrict how a game server is chosen, such as only allowing game servers on ACTIVE instances to be claimed. When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned.

An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build.  Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site.  To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases.

A container fleet can be deployed to a single location or multiple locations. Container fleets are deployed with Amazon Linux 2023 as the instance operating system. Define the fleet's container architecture using container group definitions. Each fleet can have one of the following container group types:   The game server container group runs your game server build and dependent software. Amazon GameLift deploys one or more replicas of this container group to each fleet instance. The number of replicas depends on the computing capabilities of the fleet instance in use.    An optional per-instance container group might be used to run other software that only needs to run once per instance, such as background services, logging, or test processes. One per-instance container group is deployed to each fleet instance.    Each container group can include the definition for one or more containers. A container definition specifies a container image that is stored in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) public or private repository.  Request options  Use this operation to make the following types of requests. Most fleet settings have default values, so you can create a working fleet with a minimal configuration and default values, which you can customize later.   Create a fleet with no container groups.

Amazon GameLift deploys one or more replicas of this container group to each fleet instance. The number of replicas depends on the computing capabilities of the fleet instance in use.    An optional per-instance container group might be used to run other software that only needs to run once per instance, such as background services, logging, or test processes. One per-instance container group is deployed to each fleet instance.    Each container group can include the definition for one or more containers. A container definition specifies a container image that is stored in an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) public or private repository.  Request options  Use this operation to make the following types of requests. Most fleet settings have default values, so you can create a working fleet with a minimal configuration and default values, which you can customize later.   Create a fleet with no container groups. You can configure a container fleet and then add container group definitions later. In this scenario, no fleet instances are deployed, and the fleet can't host game sessions until you add a game server container group definition. Provide the following required parameter values:    FleetRoleArn      Create a fleet with a game server container group. Provide the following required parameter values:    FleetRoleArn     GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName      Create a fleet with a game server container group and a per-instance container group. Provide the following required parameter values:    FleetRoleArn     GameServerContainerGroupDefinitionName     PerInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName       Results  If successful, this operation creates a new container fleet resource, places it in PENDING status, and initiates the fleet creation workflow. For fleets with container groups, this workflow starts a fleet deployment and transitions the status to ACTIVE. Fleets without a container group are placed in CREATED status. You can update most of the properties of a fleet, including container group definitions, and deploy the update across all fleet instances. Use a fleet update to deploy a new game server version update across the container fleet.

You can specify the container group definition's name to use the latest version. Alternatively, provide an ARN value with a specific version number. Create a container group definition by calling CreateContainerGroupDefinition. This operation creates a ContainerGroupDefinition resource.
    ///   - gameServerContainerGroupsPerInstance: The number of times to replicate the game server container group on each fleet instance.  By default, Amazon GameLift calculates the maximum number of game server container groups that can fit on each instance. This calculation is based on the CPU and memory resources of the fleet's instance type). To use the calculated maximum, don't set this parameter. If you set this number manually, Amazon GameLift uses your value as long as it's less than the calculated maximum.
    ///   - gameSessionCreationLimitPolicy: A policy that limits the number of game sessions that each individual player can create on instances in this fleet. The limit applies for a specified span of time.
    ///   - instanceConnectionPortRange: The set of port numbers to open on each fleet instance. A fleet's connection ports map to container ports that are configured in the fleet's container group definitions.  By default, Amazon GameLift calculates an optimal port range based on your fleet configuration. To use the calculated range, don't set this parameter. The values are:   Port range: 4192 to a number calculated based on your fleet configuration. Amazon GameLift uses the following formula: 4192 + [# of game server container groups per fleet instance] * [# of container ports in the game server container group definition] + [# of container ports in the game server container group definition]    You can also choose to manually set this parameter. When manually setting this parameter, you must use port numbers that match the fleet's inbound permissions port range.  If you set values manually, Amazon GameLift no longer calculates a port range for you, even if you later remove the manual settings.
    ///   - instanceInboundPermissions: The IP address ranges and port settings that allow inbound traffic to access game server processes and other processes on this fleet. As a best practice, when remotely accessing a fleet instance, we recommend opening ports only when you need them and closing them when you're finished.

When manually setting this parameter, you must use port numbers that match the fleet's connection port range.  If you set values manually, Amazon GameLift no longer calculates a port range for you, even if you later remove the manual settings.
    ///   - instanceType: The Amazon EC2 instance type to use for all instances in the fleet. For multi-location fleets, the instance type must be available in the home region and all remote locations. Instance type determines the computing resources and processing power that's available to host your game servers. This includes including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.  By default, Amazon GameLift selects an instance type that fits the needs of your container groups and is available in all selected fleet locations. You can also choose to manually set this parameter. See Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Instance Types for detailed descriptions of Amazon EC2 instance types. You can't update this fleet property later.
    ///   - locations: A set of locations to deploy container fleet instances to. You can add any Amazon Web Services Region or Local Zone that's supported by Amazon GameLift. Provide a list of one or more Amazon Web Services Region codes, such as us-west-2, or Local Zone names. Also include the fleet's home Region, which is the Amazon Web Services Region where the fleet is created. For a list of supported Regions and Local Zones, see  Amazon GameLift service locations for managed hosting.
    ///   - logConfiguration: A method for collecting container logs for the fleet. Amazon GameLift saves all standard output for each container in logs, including game session logs. You can select from the following methods:     CLOUDWATCH -- Send logs to an Amazon CloudWatch log group that you define. Each container emits a log stream, which is organized in the log group.     S3 -- Store logs in an Amazon S3 bucket that you define.    NONE -- Don't collect container logs.   By default, this property is set to CLOUDWATCH.  Amazon GameLift requires permissions to send logs other Amazon Web Services services in your account. These permissions are included in the IAM fleet role for this container fleet (see FleetRoleArn).
    ///   - metricGroups: The name of an Amazon Web Services CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. You can use a metric group  to aggregate metrics for multiple fleets. You can specify an existing metric group name or use a new name to create a new metric group. Each fleet can have only one metric group,  but you can change this value at any time.
    ///   - newGameSessionProtectionPolicy: Determines whether Amazon GameLift can shut down game sessions on the fleet that are actively running and hosting players. Amazon GameLift might prompt an instance shutdown when scaling down fleet capacity or when retiring unhealthy instances. You can also set game session protection for individual game sessions using UpdateGameSession.    NoProtection -- Game sessions can be shut down during active gameplay.     FullProtection -- Game sessions in ACTIVE status can't be shut down.   By default, this property is set to NoProtection.
    ///   - perInstanceContainerGroupDefinitionName: The name of a container group definition resource that describes a set of axillary software. A fleet instance has one process for executables in this container group. A per-instance container group is optional. You can update the fleet to add or remove a per-instance container group at any time. You can specify the container group definition's name to use the latest version. Alternatively, provide an ARN value with a specific version number.  Create a container group definition by calling CreateContainerGroupDefinition.  This operation creates a ContainerGroupDefinition resource.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - autoScalingPolicy: Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group that is optimized for game hosting. The scaling policy uses the metric "PercentUtilizedGameServers" to maintain a buffer of idle game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and players. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.
    ///   - balancingStrategy: Indicates how Amazon GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:    SPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.    SPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.    ON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.
    ///   - gameServerGroupName: An identifier for the new game server group. This value is used to generate unique ARN identifiers for the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group and the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ game server group. The name must be unique per Region per Amazon Web Services account.
    ///   - gameServerProtectionPolicy: A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected  from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might  be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game.  Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except  in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot  Instances, which can be terminated by Amazon Web Services regardless of protection status. This property is set to NO_PROTECTION by default.
    ///   - instanceDefinitions: The Amazon EC2 instance types and sizes to use in the Auto Scaling group. The instance definitions must specify at least two different instance types that are supported by Amazon GameLift FleetIQ. For more information on instance types, see EC2 Instance Types in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide. You can optionally specify capacity weighting for each instance type. If no weight value is specified for an instance type, it is set to the default value "1". For more information about capacity weighting, see Instance Weighting for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - launchTemplate: The Amazon EC2 launch template that contains configuration settings and game server code to be deployed to all instances in the game server group. You can specify the template using either the template name or ID. For help with creating a launch template, see Creating a Launch Template for an Auto Scaling Group in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Auto Scaling User Guide. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.  If you specify network interfaces in your launch template, you must explicitly set the property AssociatePublicIpAddress to "true". If no network interface is specified in the launch template, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ uses your account's default VPC.
    ///   - maxSize: The maximum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale up the group above this maximum. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.
    ///   - minSize: The minimum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ and Amazon EC2 do not scale down the group below this minimum. In production, this value should be set to at least 1. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the Amazon Web Services console or APIs.
    ///   - roleArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups.

A queue uses FleetIQ algorithms to determine the best placement locations and find an available game server there, then prompts the game server process to start a new game session.  A game session queue is configured with a set of destinations (Amazon GameLift fleets or aliases), which determine the locations where the queue can place new game sessions. These destinations can span multiple fleet types (Spot and On-Demand), instance types, and Amazon Web Services Regions. If the queue includes multi-location fleets, the queue is able to place game sessions in all of a fleet's remote locations. You can opt to filter out individual locations if needed. The queue configuration also determines how FleetIQ selects the best available placement for a new game session. Before searching for an available game server, FleetIQ first prioritizes the queue's destinations and locations, with the best placement locations on top.

To create a script resource, specify a script name and provide the script file(s). The script files and all dependencies must be combined into a single .zip file. You can upload the .zip file from either of these locations:    A locally available directory. Use the ZipFile parameter for this option.   An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket under your Amazon Web Services account. Use the StorageLocation parameter for this option. You'll need to have an Identity Access Management (IAM) role that allows the Amazon GameLift service to access your S3 bucket.    If the call is successful, Amazon GameLift creates a new script resource with a unique script ID. The script is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket that is owned by Amazon GameLift.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - name: A descriptive label that is associated with a script. Script names do not need to be unique. You can use UpdateScript to change this value later.
    ///   - storageLocation: The location of the Amazon S3 bucket where a zipped file containing your Realtime scripts is stored. The storage location must specify the Amazon S3 bucket name, the zip file name (the "key"), and a role ARN that allows Amazon GameLift to access the Amazon S3 storage location. The S3 bucket must be in the same Region where you want to create a new script. By default, Amazon GameLift uploads the latest version of the zip file; if you have S3 object versioning turned on, you can use the ObjectVersion parameter to specify an earlier version.
    ///   - tags: A list of labels to assign to the new script resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging Amazon Web Services resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see  Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. Once the resource is created, you can use TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the Amazon Web Services General Reference for actual tagging limits.
    ///   - version: Version information that is associated with a build or script. Version strings do not need to be unique. You can use UpdateScript to change this value later.
    ///   - zipFile: A data object containing your Realtime scripts and dependencies as a zip file. The zip file can have one or multiple files. Maximum size of a zip file is 5 MB. When using the Amazon Web Services CLI tool to create a script, this parameter is set to the zip file name. It must be prepended with the string "fileb://" to indicate that the file data is a binary object. For example: --zip-file fileb://myRealtimeScript.zip.

You have several options for how these resources are impacted when deleting the game server group. Depending on the type of delete operation selected, this operation might affect these resources:   The game server group   The corresponding Auto Scaling group   All game servers that are currently running in the group   To delete a game server group, identify the game server group to delete and specify the type of delete operation to initiate. Game server groups can only be deleted if they are in ACTIVE or ERROR status. If the delete request is successful, a series of operations are kicked off. The game server group status is changed to DELETE_SCHEDULED, which prevents new game servers from being registered and stops automatic scaling activity. Once all game servers in the game server group are deregistered, Amazon GameLift FleetIQ can begin deleting resources. If any of the delete operations fail, the game server group is placed in ERROR status. Amazon GameLift FleetIQ emits delete events to Amazon CloudWatch.  Learn more   Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Guide

    /// Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.  Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences. Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling.  Target-based policy  A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.  For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer.  To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.  Rule-based policy  A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.  For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%." A policy's rule statement has the following structure: If [MetricName] is [ComparisonOperator] [Threshold] for [EvaluationPeriods] minutes, then [ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment]. To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this: If [PercentIdleInstances] is [GreaterThanThreshold] [20] for [15] minutes, then [PercentChangeInCapacity] to/by [10]. To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

When searching for game sessions, you specify exactly where you want to search and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all of a fleet's locations.  This operation can be used in the following ways:    To search all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach returns game sessions in the fleet's home Region and all remote locations that fit the search criteria.   To search all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name. For location, you can specify a fleet's home Region or any remote location.   Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.  If successful, a GameSession object is returned for each game session that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in ACTIVE status only. To retrieve information on game sessions in other statuses, use DescribeGameSessions . To set search and sort criteria, create a filter expression using the following game session attributes. For game session search examples, see the Examples section of this topic.    gameSessionId -- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a GameSessionId or GameSessionArn value.     gameSessionName -- Name assigned to a game session. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.    gameSessionProperties -- A set of key-value pairs that can store custom data in a game session. For example: {"Key": "difficulty", "Value": "novice"}. The filter expression must specify the GameProperty -- a Key and a string Value to search for the game sessions. For example, to search for the above key-value pair, specify the following search filter: gameSessionProperties.difficulty = "novice". All game property values are searched as strings.  For examples of searching game sessions, see the ones below, and also see Search game sessions by game property.     maximumSessions -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session.    creationTimeMillis -- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.    playerSessionCount -- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.    hasAvailablePlayerSessions -- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join.     Returned values for playerSessionCount and hasAvailablePlayerSessions change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time.

    ///   - filterExpression: String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in ACTIVE status. A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists of the following:    Operand -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are gameSessionName, gameSessionId, gameSessionProperties, maximumSessions, creationTimeMillis, playerSessionCount, hasAvailablePlayerSessions.    Comparator -- Valid comparators are: =, <>, , >, , >=.     Value -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators = and <>. For example, the following filter expression searches on gameSessionName: "FilterExpression": "gameSessionName = 'Matt\\'s Awesome Game 1'".    To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords AND, OR, and NOT and parentheses as needed. For example: x AND y AND NOT z, NOT (x OR y). Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:    =, <>, , >, , >=    Parentheses   NOT   AND   OR   For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: "maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true".

    /// Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules. With games that use Amazon GameLift managed hosting, this operation also triggers Amazon GameLift to find hosting resources and start a new game session for the new match. Each matchmaking request includes information on one or more players and specifies the FlexMatch matchmaker to use. When a request is for multiple players, FlexMatch attempts to build a match that includes all players in the request, placing them in the same team and finding additional players as needed to fill the match.  To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include any player attributes that are required by the matchmaking configuration's rule set. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to QUEUED.  Track matchmaking events to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches. Ticket status updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service, which is defined in the matchmaking configuration.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - balancingStrategy: Indicates how Amazon GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:    SPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.    SPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.    ON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.
    ///   - gameServerGroupName: A unique identifier for the game server group. Use either the name or ARN value.
    ///   - gameServerProtectionPolicy: A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected  from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might  be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game.  Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except  in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot  Instances, which can be terminated by Amazon Web Services regardless of protection status. This property is set to NO_PROTECTION by default.
    ///   - instanceDefinitions: An updated list of Amazon EC2 instance types to use in the Auto Scaling group.

    ///   - filterExpression: String containing the search criteria for the session search. If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in ACTIVE status. A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists of the following:    Operand -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are gameSessionName, gameSessionId, gameSessionProperties, maximumSessions, creationTimeMillis, playerSessionCount, hasAvailablePlayerSessions.    Comparator -- Valid comparators are: =, <>, , >, , >=.     Value -- Value to be searched for. Values may be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings depending on the operand. String values are case sensitive and must be enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators = and <>. For example, the following filter expression searches on gameSessionName: "FilterExpression": "gameSessionName = 'Matt\\'s Awesome Game 1'".    To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords AND, OR, and NOT and parentheses as needed. For example: x AND y AND NOT z, NOT (x OR y). Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:    =, <>, , >, , >=    Parentheses   NOT   AND   OR   For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: "maximumSessions>=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true".
    ///   - fleetId: A unique identifier for the fleet to search for active game sessions. You can use either the fleet ID or ARN value. Each request must reference either a fleet ID or alias ID, but not both.

    ///   - location: A fleet location to search for game sessions. You can specify a fleet's home Region or a remote location. Use the Amazon Web Services Region code format, such as us-west-2.
    ///   - sortExpression: Instructions on how to sort the search results. If no sort expression is included, the request returns results in random order. A sort expression consists of the following elements:    Operand -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are gameSessionName, gameSessionId, gameSessionProperties, maximumSessions, creationTimeMillis, playerSessionCount, hasAvailablePlayerSessions.    Order -- Valid sort orders are ASC (ascending) and DESC (descending).   For example, this sort expression returns the oldest active sessions first: "SortExpression": "creationTimeMillis ASC". Results with a null value for the sort operand are returned at the end of the list.
