    ///  Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.  When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error. To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status PLACING, where a new game session is created for the match.  If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to SEARCHING to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to CANCELLED, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed.

    ///   This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.  Locates an available game server and temporarily reserves it to host gameplay and players. This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in CLAIMED status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server.  To claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information.  When a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server's utilization status remains AVAILABLE while the claim status is set to CLAIMED for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to UTILIZED (using UpdateGameServer) once players join. If the game server's status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable. If you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following cases:   If the game server utilization status is UTILIZED.   If the game server claim status is CLAIMED.    When claiming a specific game server, this request will succeed even if the game server is running on an instance in DRAINING status. To avoid this, first check the instance status by calling DescribeGameServerInstances.

    ///  Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build.  Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site.  To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID and an ARN. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling UpdateAlias.

    ///  Creates a new Amazon GameLift build resource for your game server binary files. Game server binaries must be combined into a zip file for use with Amazon GameLift.   When setting up a new game build for GameLift, we recommend using the AWS CLI command  upload-build . This helper command combines two tasks: (1) it uploads your build files from a file directory to a GameLift Amazon S3 location, and (2) it creates a new build resource.   The CreateBuild operation can used in the following scenarios:   To create a new game build with build files that are in an S3 location under an AWS account that you control. To use this option, you must first give Amazon GameLift access to the S3 bucket. With permissions in place, call CreateBuild and specify a build name, operating system, and the S3 storage location of your game build.   To directly upload your build files to a GameLift S3 location. To use this option, first call CreateBuild and specify a build name and operating system. This operation creates a new build resource and also returns an S3 location with temporary access credentials. Use the credentials to manually upload your build files to the specified S3 location. For more information, see Uploading Objects in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide. Build files can be uploaded to the GameLift S3 location once only; that can't be updated.    If successful, this operation creates a new build resource with a unique build ID and places it in INITIALIZED status. A build must be in READY status before you can create fleets with it.

    ///  Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. whether they are custom game builds or Realtime Servers with game-specific script. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can host multiple game sessions. When creating a fleet, you choose the hardware specifications, set some configuration options, and specify the game server to deploy on the new fleet.  To create a new fleet, provide the following: (1) a fleet name, (2) an EC2 instance type and fleet type (spot or on-demand), (3) the build ID for your game build or script ID if using Realtime Servers, and (4) a runtime configuration, which determines how game servers will run on each instance in the fleet.  If the CreateFleet call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following tasks. You can track the process of a fleet by checking the fleet status or by monitoring fleet creation events:   Creates a fleet resource. Status: NEW.   Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the Amazon GameLift console.   Sets the fleet's target capacity to 1 (desired instances), which triggers Amazon GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.   Downloads the game build or Realtime script to the new instance and installs it. Statuses: DOWNLOADING, VALIDATING, BUILDING.    Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is configured to run multiple server processes per instance, Amazon GameLift staggers each process launch by a few seconds. Status: ACTIVATING.   Sets the fleet's status to ACTIVE as soon as one server process is ready to host a game session.

    ///   This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.  Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon EC2 instances for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account, and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of your game server groups in the GameLift console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch. Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:    An Amazon EC2 launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon EC2 instances with your game server build. For more information, see  Launching an Instance from a Launch Template in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.    An IAM role that extends limited access to your AWS account to allow GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see Create IAM roles for cross-service interaction in the GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide.   To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon EC2 launch template, and provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift FleetIQ metric. Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.

    ///  Creates a multiplayer game session for players. This operation creates a game session record and assigns an available server process in the specified fleet to host the game session. A fleet must have an ACTIVE status before a game session can be created in it. To create a game session, specify either fleet ID or alias ID and indicate a maximum number of players to allow in the game session. You can also provide a name and game-specific properties for this game session. If successful, a GameSession object is returned containing the game session properties and other settings you specified.  Idempotency tokens. You can add a token that uniquely identifies game session requests. This is useful for ensuring that game session requests are idempotent. Multiple requests with the same idempotency token are processed only once; subsequent requests return the original result. All response values are the same with the exception of game session status, which may change.  Resource creation limits. If you are creating a game session on a fleet with a resource creation limit policy in force, then you must specify a creator ID. Without this ID, Amazon GameLift has no way to evaluate the policy for this new game session request.  Player acceptance policy. By default, newly created game sessions are open to new players.

    ///  Establishes a new queue for processing requests to place new game sessions. A queue identifies where new game sessions can be hosted -- by specifying a list of destinations (fleets or aliases) -- and how long requests can wait in the queue before timing out. You can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple Regions. To add placement requests to a queue, call StartGameSessionPlacement and reference the queue name.  Destination order. When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.  Player latency policies. For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc.  To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies.

Instead, as a best practice, set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to receive notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration.

    ///  Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.  Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences. You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling StopFleetActions with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call StartFleetActions with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with DeleteScalingPolicy. Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling.  Target-based policy  A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.  For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer.  To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.  Rule-based policy  A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.  For example, a policy may make the following statement: "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%." A policy's rule statement has the following structure: If [MetricName] is [ComparisonOperator] [Threshold] for [EvaluationPeriods] minutes, then [ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment]. To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this: If [PercentIdleInstances] is [GreaterThanThreshold] [20] for [15] minutes, then [PercentChangeInCapacity] to/by [10]. To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.

When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order. Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each Region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players.  To place a new game session request, specify the following:   The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings   A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the placement request   (Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for each player)   Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players)   If successful, a new game session placement is created. To track the status of a placement request, call DescribeGameSessionPlacement and check the request's status. If the status is FULFILLED, a new game session has been created and a game session ARN and Region are referenced. If the placement request times out, you can resubmit the request or retry it with a different queue.

    ///  Finds new players to fill open slots in an existing game session. This operation can be used to add players to matched games that start with fewer than the maximum number of players or to replace players when they drop out. By backfilling with the same matchmaker used to create the original match, you ensure that new players meet the match criteria and maintain a consistent experience throughout the game session. You can backfill a match anytime after a game session has been created.  To request a match backfill, specify a unique ticket ID, the existing game session's ARN, a matchmaking configuration, and a set of data that describes all current players in the game session. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED. The ticket is placed in the matchmaker's ticket pool and processed. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed.  The process of finding backfill matches is essentially identical to the initial matchmaking process. The matchmaker searches the pool and groups tickets together to form potential matches, allowing only one backfill ticket per potential match. Once the a match is formed, the matchmaker creates player sessions for the new players. All tickets in the match are updated with the game session's connection information, and the GameSession object is updated to include matchmaker data on the new players.

    ///  Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.). The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place a new game session are defined in a MatchmakingConfiguration.  To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to QUEUED.  Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches. Ticket status updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), which is defined in the matchmaking configuration.  Processing a matchmaking request -- FlexMatch handles a matchmaking request as follows:    Your client code submits a StartMatchmaking request for one or more players and tracks the status of the request ticket.    FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an acceptable match. When a potential match is identified, all tickets in the proposed match are advanced to the next status.    If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking configuration), the tickets move into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This status triggers your client code to solicit acceptance from all players in every ticket involved in the match, and then call AcceptMatch for each player. If any player rejects or fails to accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped (see AcceptMatch for more details).   Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets move into status PLACING. FlexMatch locates resources for a new game session using the game session queue (set in the matchmaking configuration) and creates the game session based on the match data.    When the match is successfully placed, the matchmaking tickets move into COMPLETED status. Connection information (including game session endpoint and player session) is added to the matchmaking tickets. Matched players can use the connection information to join the game.
