    ///  Retrieves all active game sessions that match a set of search criteria and sorts them in a specified order. You can search or sort by the following game session attributes:    gameSessionId -- A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a GameSessionId or GameSessionArn value.     gameSessionName -- Name assigned to a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession. Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.    gameSessionProperties -- Custom data defined in a game session's GameProperty parameter. GameProperty values are stored as key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the key and a string to search the data values for. For example, to search for game sessions with custom data containing the key:value pair "gameMode:brawl", specify the following: gameSessionProperties.gameMode = "brawl". All custom data values are searched as strings.    maximumSessions -- Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession.    creationTimeMillis -- Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.    playerSessionCount -- Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.    hasAvailablePlayerSessions -- Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join.     Returned values for playerSessionCount and hasAvailablePlayerSessions change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to refresh search results often, and handle sessions that fill up before a player can join.   To search or sort, specify either a fleet ID or an alias ID, and provide a search filter expression, a sort expression, or both. If successful, a collection of GameSession objects matching the request is returned. Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.  You can search for game sessions one fleet at a time only. To find game sessions across multiple fleets, you must search each fleet separately and combine the results. This search feature finds only game sessions that are in ACTIVE status. To locate games in statuses other than active, use DescribeGameSessionDetails.    CreateGameSession     DescribeGameSessions     DescribeGameSessionDetails     SearchGameSessions     UpdateGameSession     GetGameSessionLogUrl    Game session placements    StartGameSessionPlacement     DescribeGameSessionPlacement     StopGameSessionPlacement
