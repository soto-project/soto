/// Service object for interacting with AWS Route53Resolver service.
///
/// When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS resolution within the VPC
/// 			from Route 53 Resolver. By default, Resolver answers DNS queries for VPC domain names
/// 			such as domain names for EC2 instances or Elastic Load Balancing load balancers.
/// 			Resolver performs recursive lookups against public name servers for all other domain
/// 			names.
/// 		       You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and your network over a Direct Connect or VPN connection:
/// 		        Forward DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53 Resolver
/// 		       DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers
/// 			to easily resolve domain names for Amazon Web Services resources such as EC2 instances or records in a Route 53 private hosted zone.
/// 			For more information, see
/// 			How DNS Resolvers
/// 			on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.
///
/// 		        Conditionally forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network
/// 		       You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2 instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network.
/// 			To forward selected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names for the DNS queries that you want to forward
/// 			(such as example.com), and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to forward the queries to.
/// 			If a query matches multiple rules (example.com, acme.example.com), Resolver chooses the rule with the most specific match
/// 			(acme.example.com) and forwards the query to the IP addresses that you specified in that rule. For more information, see
/// 			How Route 53 Resolver
/// 			Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.
/// 		       Like Amazon VPC, Resolver is Regional. In each Region where you have VPCs, you can choose
/// 			whether to forward queries from your VPCs to your network (outbound queries), from your
/// 			network to your VPCs (inbound queries), or both.
