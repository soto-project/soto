Canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. You can set up a canary to run continuously or just once.  Do not use CreateCanary to modify an existing canary. Use UpdateCanary instead. To create canaries, you must have the CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess policy. If you are creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also need the iam:CreateRole, iam:CreatePolicy and iam:AttachRolePolicy permissions. For more information, see Necessary Roles and Permissions. Do not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names. The canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls over the internet. For more information, see Security Considerations for Synthetics Canaries.

Using groups can help you with managing and automating your canaries, and you can also view aggregated run results and statistics for all canaries in a group.  Groups are global resources. When you create a group, it is replicated across Amazon Web Services Regions, and  you can view it and add canaries to it from any Region. Although the group ARN format reflects the Region name where it was created, a group is not constrained to any Region.  This means that you can put canaries from multiple Regions into the same group, and then use that group to view and manage all of those canaries in a single view. Groups are supported in all Regions except the Regions that are disabled by default. For more information about these Regions, see Enabling a Region. Each group can contain as many as 10 canaries. You can have as many as 20 groups in your account. Any single canary can be a member of up to 10 groups.

These logs groups have the name /aws/lambda/cwsyn-MyCanaryName .     Before you delete a canary, you might want to use GetCanary to display the information about this canary.
