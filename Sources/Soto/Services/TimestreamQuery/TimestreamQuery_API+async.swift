Because Timestream’s SDKs are designed to transparently work with the service’s architecture,  including the management and mapping of the service endpoints, it is not recommended that you use this API unless:   Your application uses a programming language that does not yet have SDK support   You require better control over the client-side implementation   For detailed information on how to use DescribeEndpoints,  see The Endpoint Discovery Pattern and REST APIs.
