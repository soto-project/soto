/// The Identity Store service used by IAM Identity Center provides a single place to retrieve all of your identities (users and groups). For more information, see the IAM Identity Center User Guide. This reference guide describes the identity store operations that you can call programmatically and includes detailed information about data types and errors.  IAM Identity Center uses the sso and identitystore API namespaces.
