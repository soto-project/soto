/// Service object for interacting with AWS ConnectParticipant service.
///
/// Amazon Connect is an easy-to-use omnichannel cloud contact center service that enables companies of any size to deliver superior customer service at a lower cost. Amazon Connect communications capabilities make it easy for companies to deliver personalized interactions across communication channels, including chat.  Use the Amazon Connect Participant Service to manage participants (for example, agents, customers, and managers listening in), and to send messages and events within a chat contact. The APIs in the service enable the following: sending chat messages, attachment sharing, managing a participant's connection state and message events, and retrieving chat transcripts.
