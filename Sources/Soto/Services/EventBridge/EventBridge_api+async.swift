    /// Adds the specified targets to the specified rule, or updates the targets if they are already associated with the rule. Targets are the resources that are invoked when a rule is triggered.  Each rule can have up to five (5) targets associated with it at one time.  You can configure the following as targets for Events:
    ///     API destination     API Gateway    Batch job queue   CloudWatch group   CodeBuild project   CodePipeline   EC2 CreateSnapshot API call   EC2 Image Builder   EC2 RebootInstances API call   EC2 StopInstances API call   EC2 TerminateInstances API call   ECS task    Event bus in a different account or  Region     Event bus in the same account and Region    Firehose delivery stream   Glue workflow    Incident Manager response plan    Inspector assessment template   Kinesis stream   Lambda function   Redshift cluster   SageMaker Pipeline   SNS topic   SQS queue   Step Functions state machine   Systems Manager Automation   Systems Manager OpsItem   Systems Manager Run Command
    ///  Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the Amazon Web Services Management Console. The built-in targets are EC2 CreateSnapshot API call, EC2 RebootInstances API call, EC2 StopInstances API call, and EC2 TerminateInstances API call.
    ///  For some target types, PutTargets provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the KinesisParameters argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the RunCommandParameters field.
    ///  To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge needs the appropriate permissions. For Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis Data Streams,  Step Functions state machines and API Gateway REST APIs, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the RoleARN argument in PutTargets. For more information, see Authentication and Access Control in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
    ///  If another Amazon Web Services account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using PutPermission), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the Arn value when you run PutTargets. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information, see Amazon EventBridge Pricing.
    ///    Input, InputPath, and InputTransformer are not available with PutTarget if the target is an event bus of a different Amazon Web Services  account.
    ///  If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions in the Target structure. For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between Amazon Web Services Accounts in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
    ///  For more information about enabling cross-account events, see PutPermission.
    ///   Input, InputPath, and InputTransformer are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event:
    ///    If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target).   If Input is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant.   If InputPath is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, $.detail), then only the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is passed).   If InputTransformer is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.
    ///  When you specify InputPath or InputTransformer, you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation.
    ///  When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.
