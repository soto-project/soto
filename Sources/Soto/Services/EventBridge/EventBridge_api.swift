/// Service object for interacting with AWS EventBridge service.
///
/// Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your Amazon Web Services resources. When your resources change state, they automatically send events to an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For example, you can configure rules to:   Automatically invoke an Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.   Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.   Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.   For more information about the features of Amazon EventBridge, see the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.

A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated by Amazon Web Services services go to your account's default event bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or applications go to the matching partner event bus. If you have custom applications or services, you can specify whether their events go to your default event bus or a custom event bus that you have created. For more information, see CreateEventBus. If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you specify in this PutRule command. If you omit arguments in PutRule, the old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are replaced with null values. When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect. A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule. When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use the PutRule operation and assign tags, you must have both the events:PutRule and events:TagResource permissions. If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the PutRule operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use TagResource and UntagResource. Most services in Amazon Web Services treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match. In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop. To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change.  An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit. For more information, see Managing Your Costs with Budgets.

The maximum number of entries per request is 10.  Each rule can have up to five (5) targets associated with it at one time.  For a list of services you can configure as targets for events, see EventBridge targets in the  Amazon EventBridge User Guide . Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the Amazon Web Services Management Console. The built-in targets are:    Amazon EBS CreateSnapshot API call     Amazon EC2 RebootInstances API call     Amazon EC2 StopInstances API call     Amazon EC2 TerminateInstances API call    For some target types, PutTargets provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the KinesisParameters argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the RunCommandParameters field. To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge needs the appropriate permissions:    For Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies.   For EC2 instances, Kinesis Data Streams, Step Functions state machines and API Gateway APIs, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the RoleARN argument in PutTargets.   For more information, see Authentication and Access Control in the  Amazon EventBridge User Guide . If another Amazon Web Services account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using PutPermission), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the Arn value when you run PutTargets. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is not charged. For more information, see Amazon EventBridge Pricing.   Input, InputPath, and InputTransformer are not available with PutTarget if the target is an event bus of a different Amazon Web Services account.  If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions in the Target structure. For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between Amazon Web Services Accounts in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.  If you have an IAM role on a cross-account event bus target, a PutTargets call without a role on the same target (same Id and Arn) will not remove the role.  For more information about enabling cross-account events, see PutPermission.  Input, InputPath, and InputTransformer are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is triggered due to a matched event:   If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event is passed to the target).   If Input is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant.   If InputPath is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, $.detail), then only the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is passed).   If InputTransformer is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.   When you specify InputPath or InputTransformer, you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation. When you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect. This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If that happens, FailedEntryCount is non-zero in the response and each entry in FailedEntries provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.

The identifier can be the key  Amazon Resource Name (ARN), KeyId, key alias, or key alias ARN. If you do not specify a customer managed key identifier, EventBridge uses an Amazon Web Services owned key to encrypt events on the event bus. For more information, see Managing keys in the Key Management Service Developer Guide.   Archives and schema discovery are not supported for event buses encrypted using a customer managed key. EventBridge returns an error if:   You call  CreateArchive on an event bus set to use a customer managed key for encryption.   You call  CreateDiscoverer on an event bus set to use a customer managed key for encryption.   You call  UpdatedEventBus to set a customer managed key on an event bus with an archives or schema discovery enabled.   To enable archives or schema discovery on an event bus, choose to use an Amazon Web Services owned key. For more information, see Data encryption in EventBridge in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
