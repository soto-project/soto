    ///   - dnsIpAddresses: Specifies the IPv4 addresses for the DNS servers that your SMB file server belongs to. This parameter applies only if AuthenticationType is set to KERBEROS. If you have multiple domains in your environment, configuring this parameter makes sure that DataSync connects to the right SMB file server.
    ///   - domain: Specifies the Windows domain name that your SMB file server belongs to. This parameter applies only if AuthenticationType is set to NTLM. If you have multiple domains in your environment, configuring this parameter makes sure that DataSync connects to the right file server.
    ///   - kerberosKeytab: Specifies your Kerberos key table (keytab) file, which includes mappings between your Kerberos principal and encryption keys. The file must be base64 encoded. If you're using the CLI, the encoding is done for you. To avoid task execution errors, make sure that the Kerberos principal that you use to create the keytab file matches exactly what you specify for KerberosPrincipal.
    ///   - kerberosKrb5Conf: Specifies a Kerberos configuration file (krb5.conf) that defines your Kerberos realm configuration. The file must be base64 encoded. If you're using the CLI, the encoding is done for you.
    ///   - kerberosPrincipal: Specifies a Kerberos prinicpal, which is an identity in your Kerberos realm that has permission to access the files, folders, and file metadata in your SMB file server. A Kerberos principal might look like HOST/kerberosuser@MYDOMAIN.ORG. Principal names are case sensitive. Your DataSync task execution will fail if the principal that you specify for this parameter doesn’t exactly match the principal that you use to create the keytab file.
    ///   - mountOptions: Specifies the version of the SMB protocol that DataSync uses to access your SMB file server.
    ///   - password: Specifies the password of the user who can mount your SMB file server and has permission to access the files and folders involved in your transfer. This parameter applies only if AuthenticationType is set to NTLM.
    ///   - serverHostname: Specifies the domain name or IP address of the SMB file server that your DataSync agent connects to. Remember the following when configuring this parameter:   You can't specify an IP version 6 (IPv6) address.   If you're using Kerberos authentication, you must specify a domain name.
    ///   - subdirectory: Specifies the name of the share exported by your SMB file server where DataSync will read or write data. You can include a subdirectory in the share path (for example, /path/to/subdirectory). Make sure that other SMB clients in your network can also mount this path. To copy all data in the subdirectory, DataSync must be able to mount the SMB share and access all of its data. For more information, see Providing DataSync access to SMB file servers.

    ///   - destinationLocationArn: Specifies the ARN of your transfer's destination location.
    ///   - excludes: Specifies exclude filters that define the files, objects, and folders in your source location that you don't want DataSync to transfer. For more information and examples, see Specifying what DataSync transfers by using filters.
    ///   - includes: Specifies include filters that define the files, objects, and folders in your source location that you want DataSync to transfer. For more information and examples, see Specifying what DataSync transfers by using filters.
    ///   - manifestConfig: Configures a manifest, which is a list of files or objects that you want DataSync to transfer. For more information and configuration examples, see Specifying what DataSync transfers by using a manifest. When using this parameter, your caller identity (the role that you're using DataSync with) must have the iam:PassRole permission. The AWSDataSyncFullAccess policy includes this permission.
    ///   - name: Specifies the name of your task.
    ///   - options: Specifies your task's settings, such as preserving file metadata, verifying data integrity, among other options.
    ///   - schedule: Specifies a schedule for when you want your task to run. For more information, see Scheduling your task.
    ///   - sourceLocationArn: Specifies the ARN of your transfer's source location.
    ///   - tags: Specifies the tags that you want to apply to your task.  Tags are key-value pairs that help you manage, filter, and search for your DataSync resources.
    ///   - taskMode: Specifies one of the following task modes for your data transfer:    ENHANCED - Transfer virtually unlimited numbers of objects with higher performance than Basic mode. Enhanced mode tasks optimize the data transfer process by listing, preparing, transferring, and verifying data in parallel. Enhanced mode is currently available for transfers between Amazon S3 locations.  To create an Enhanced mode task, the IAM role that you use to call the CreateTask operation must have the iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission.     BASIC (default) - Transfer files or objects between Amazon Web Services storage and all other supported DataSync locations. Basic mode tasks are subject to quotas on the number of files, objects, and directories in a dataset. Basic mode sequentially prepares, transfers, and verifies data, making it slower than Enhanced mode for most workloads.   For more information, see Understanding task mode differences.

For more information, see Monitoring your DataSync transfers with task reports.
