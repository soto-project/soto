    ///   - accessToken: The personal access token for a GitHub repository for an Amplify app. The personal access token is used to authorize access to a GitHub repository using the Amplify GitHub App. The token is not stored. Use accessToken for GitHub repositories only. To authorize access to a repository provider such as Bitbucket or CodeCommit, use oauthToken. You must specify either accessToken or oauthToken when you create a new app. Existing Amplify apps deployed from a GitHub repository using OAuth continue to work with CI/CD. However, we strongly recommend that you migrate these apps to use the GitHub App. For more information, see Migrating an existing OAuth app to the Amplify GitHub App in the Amplify User Guide .
    ///   - autoBranchCreationConfig: The automated branch creation configuration for an Amplify app.
    ///   - autoBranchCreationPatterns: The automated branch creation glob patterns for an Amplify app.

    ///   - buildSpec: The build specification (build spec) for an Amplify app.
    ///   - cacheConfig: The cache configuration for the Amplify app.
    ///   - computeRoleArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to assign to an SSR app. The SSR Compute role allows the Amplify Hosting compute service to securely access specific Amazon Web Services resources based on the role's permissions. For more information about the SSR Compute role, see Adding an SSR Compute role in the Amplify User Guide.

    ///   - enableBranchAutoDeletion: Automatically disconnects a branch in the Amplify console when you delete a branch from your Git repository.

    ///   - name: The name of the Amplify app.
    ///   - oauthToken: The OAuth token for a third-party source control system for an Amplify app. The OAuth token is used to create a webhook and a read-only deploy key using SSH cloning. The OAuth token is not stored. Use oauthToken for repository providers other than GitHub, such as Bitbucket or CodeCommit. To authorize access to GitHub as your repository provider, use accessToken. You must specify either oauthToken or accessToken when you create a new app. Existing Amplify apps deployed from a GitHub repository using OAuth continue to work with CI/CD. However, we strongly recommend that you migrate these apps to use the GitHub App. For more information, see Migrating an existing OAuth app to the Amplify GitHub App in the Amplify User Guide .

For an app requiring Amplify Hosting's original SSR support only, set the platform type to WEB_DYNAMIC. If you are deploying an SSG only app with Next.js version 14 or later, you must set the platform type to WEB_COMPUTE and set the artifacts baseDirectory to .next in the application's build settings. For an example of the build specification settings, see Amplify build settings for a Next.js 14 SSG application in the Amplify Hosting User Guide.

    ///   - oauthToken: The OAuth token for a third-party source control system for an Amplify app. The OAuth token is used to create a webhook and a read-only deploy key using SSH cloning. The OAuth token is not stored. Use oauthToken for repository providers other than GitHub, such as Bitbucket or CodeCommit. To authorize access to GitHub as your repository provider, use accessToken. You must specify either oauthToken or accessToken when you update an app. Existing Amplify apps deployed from a GitHub repository using OAuth continue to work with CI/CD. However, we strongly recommend that you migrate these apps to use the GitHub App. For more information, see Migrating an existing OAuth app to the Amplify GitHub App in the Amplify User Guide .

For an app requiring Amplify Hosting's original SSR support only, set the platform type to WEB_DYNAMIC. If you are deploying an SSG only app with Next.js version 14 or later, you must set the platform type to WEB_COMPUTE.
