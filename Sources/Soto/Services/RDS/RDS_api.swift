/// Service object for interacting with AWS RDS service.
///
/// Amazon Relational Database Service  Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and  scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational  database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications  and businesses unique. Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server,  Oracle, Db2, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools  you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS  automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS  is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your  application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for  the resources you use. This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface  you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might  require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this  reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot,  or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics  from the user guide.  Amazon RDS API Reference    For the alphabetical list of API actions, see  API Actions.   For the alphabetical list of data types, see  Data Types.   For a list of common query parameters, see  Common Parameters.   For descriptions of the error codes, see  Common Errors.    Amazon RDS User Guide    For a summary of the Amazon RDS interfaces, see  Available RDS Interfaces.   For more information about how to use the Query API, see  Using the Query API.

    ///   - kmsKeyId: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB cluster snapshot.  The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the Amazon Web Services KMS key. If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from your Amazon Web Services account, you can specify a value for KmsKeyId to encrypt the copy with a new KMS key.  If you don't specify a value for KmsKeyId, then the copy of the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB cluster snapshot. If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot that is shared from another Amazon Web Services account, then you must specify a value for KmsKeyId. To copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot to another Amazon Web Services Region, you must set KmsKeyId to the Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier  you want to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services  Region that they are created in, and you can't use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region  in another Amazon Web Services Region. If you copy an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot and specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter,  an error is returned.
    ///   - preSignedUrl: When you are copying a DB cluster snapshot from one Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the CopyDBClusterSnapshot API operation in the Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB cluster snapshot to copy. Use the PreSignedUrl parameter when copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services Region. Don't specify PreSignedUrl when copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot in the same Amazon Web Services Region. This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions. The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBClusterSnapshot API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to copy. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:    KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the CopyDBClusterSnapshot operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.    DestinationRegion - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region  that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in.    SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier - The DB cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted DB cluster  snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example,  if you are copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115.   To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see   Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) and  Signature Version 4 Signing Process.  If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.

    ///   - preSignedUrl: When you are replicating a DB cluster from one Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region to another, an URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the CreateDBCluster operation to be called in the source Amazon Web Services Region where the DB cluster is replicated from. Specify PreSignedUrl only when you are performing cross-Region replication from an encrypted DB cluster. The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CreateDBCluster API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster to copy. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:    KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This should refer to the same KMS key for both the CreateDBCluster operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.    DestinationRegion - The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that Aurora read replica will be created in.    ReplicationSourceIdentifier - The DB cluster identifier for the encrypted DB cluster to be copied.  This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are copying an  encrypted DB cluster from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your ReplicationSourceIdentifier would look like Example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1.   To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see   Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) and  Signature Version 4 Signing Process.  If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.  Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only
    ///   - publiclyAccessible: Specifies whether the DB cluster is publicly accessible. When the DB cluster is publicly accessible and you connect from outside of the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC),  its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB cluster,  the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it. When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. Valid for Cluster Type: Multi-AZ DB clusters only Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether DBSubnetGroupName is specified. If DBSubnetGroupName isn't specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified, the following applies:   If the default VPC in the target Region doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.   If the default VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.   If DBSubnetGroupName is specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't specified, the following applies:   If the subnets are part of a VPC that doesn’t have an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.   If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is public.
    ///   - rdsCustomClusterConfiguration: Reserved for future use.
    ///   - replicationSourceIdentifier: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source DB instance or DB cluster if this DB cluster is created as a read replica. Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters
    ///   - scalingConfiguration: For DB clusters in serverless DB engine mode, the scaling properties of the DB cluster. Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters only
    ///   - serverlessV2ScalingConfiguration: 
    ///   - storageEncrypted: Specifies whether the DB cluster is encrypted. Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

For information on storage types for Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Settings for creating Multi-AZ DB clusters. This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster. When specified for a Multi-AZ DB cluster, a value for the Iops parameter is required. Valid for Cluster Type: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters Valid Values:   Aurora DB clusters - aurora | aurora-iopt1    Multi-AZ DB clusters - io1 | io2 | gp3    Default:   Aurora DB clusters - aurora    Multi-AZ DB clusters - io1     When you create an Aurora DB cluster with the storage type set to aurora-iopt1, the storage type is returned in the response.

    ///   - enableCloudwatchLogsExports: The list of logs that the new DB instance is to export to CloudWatch Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine being used. For more information, see  Publishing Database Logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs  in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - enableCustomerOwnedIp: Specifies whether to enable a customer-owned IP address (CoIP) for an RDS on Outposts read replica. A CoIP provides local or external connectivity to resources in your Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For some use cases, a CoIP can provide lower latency for connections to the read replica from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your local network. For more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts  in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For more information about CoIPs, see Customer-owned IP addresses  in the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide.
    ///   - enableIAMDatabaseAuthentication: Specifies whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts.

    ///   - enablePerformanceInsights: Specifies whether to enable Performance Insights for the read replica. For more information, see Using Amazon Performance Insights in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - iops: The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) to initially allocate for the DB instance.
    ///   - kmsKeyId: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted read replica. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the source DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster, don't specify a value for this parameter. A read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region is always encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB instance or cluster. If you create an encrypted read replica in a different Amazon Web Services Region, then you must specify a KMS key identifier for the destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and you can't use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon Web Services Region. You can't create an encrypted read replica from an unencrypted DB instance or Multi-AZ DB cluster. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom, which uses the same KMS key as the primary  replica.
    ///   - maxAllocatedStorage: The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automatically scale the storage of the DB instance. For more information about this setting, including limitations that apply to it, see   Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling  in the Amazon RDS User Guide.
    ///   - monitoringInterval: The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for the read replica. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0. If MonitoringRoleArn is specified, then you must set MonitoringInterval to a value other than 0. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60  Default: 0
    ///   - monitoringRoleArn: The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example, arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess. For information on creating a monitoring role, go to To  create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide. If MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, then you must  supply a MonitoringRoleArn value. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - multiAZ: Specifies whether the read replica is in a Multi-AZ deployment. You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. RDS creates a standby of your replica in another Availability Zone for failover support for the replica. Creating your read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance is independent of whether the source is a Multi-AZ DB instance or a Multi-AZ DB cluster. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - networkType: The network type of the DB instance. Valid Values:    IPV4     DUAL    The network type is determined by the DBSubnetGroup specified for read replica.  A DBSubnetGroup can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6  protocols (DUAL). For more information, see  Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the  Amazon RDS User Guide.
    ///   - optionGroupName: The option group to associate the DB instance with. If not specified, RDS uses the option group associated with the source DB instance or cluster.  For SQL Server, you must use the option group associated with the source.  This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - performanceInsightsKMSKeyId: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you do not specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId, then Amazon RDS  uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account.  Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - performanceInsightsRetentionPeriod: The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values:    7     month * 31, where month is a number of months from 1-23.  Examples: 93 (3 months * 31), 341 (11 months * 31), 589 (19 months * 31)    731    Default: 7 days If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as 94,  Amazon RDS returns an error.
    ///   - port: The port number that the DB instance uses for connections. Valid Values: 1150-65535  Default: Inherits the value from the source DB instance.
    ///   - preSignedUrl: When you are creating a read replica from one Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region to another or from one China Amazon Web Services Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4 signed request for the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API operation in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB instance. This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions and  China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions. This setting applies only when replicating from a source DB instance. Source DB clusters aren't supported in Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Regions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. You must specify this parameter when you create an encrypted read replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS API. Don't specify PreSignedUrl when you are creating an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region. The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB instance. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:    DestinationRegion - The Amazon Web Services Region that the encrypted read replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services Region is the same one where the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation is called that contains this presigned URL. For example, if you create an encrypted DB instance in the us-west-1 Amazon Web Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then you call the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.    KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the read replica in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica operation that is called in the destination Amazon Web Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.    SourceDBInstanceIdentifier - The DB instance identifier for the encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Services Region. For example, if you are creating an encrypted read replica from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your SourceDBInstanceIdentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:instance:mysql-instance1-20161115.   To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see  Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process.  If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for the CLI) instead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRegion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid request for the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Region.  This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - processorFeatures: The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the DB instance class of the DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - publiclyAccessible: Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible. When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it. When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address. For more information, see CreateDBInstance.
    ///   - replicaMode: The open mode of the replica database: mounted or read-only.  This parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances.  Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition. The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload. You can create a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see Working with Oracle Read Replicas for Amazon RDS  in the Amazon RDS User Guide. For RDS Custom, you must specify this parameter and set it to mounted. The value won't be set by default.  After replica creation, you can manage the open mode manually.
    ///   - sourceDBClusterIdentifier: The identifier of the Multi-AZ DB cluster that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB cluster can have up to 15 read replicas. Constraints:   Must be the identifier of an existing Multi-AZ DB cluster.   Can't be specified if the SourceDBInstanceIdentifier parameter is also specified.   The specified DB cluster must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.   The source DB cluster must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the read replica. Cross-Region replication isn't supported.
    ///   - sourceDBInstanceIdentifier: The identifier of the DB instance that will act as the source for the read replica. Each DB instance can have up to 15 read replicas, with the exception of Oracle and SQL Server, which can have up to five. Constraints:   Must be the identifier of an existing Db2, MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server DB instance.   Can't be specified if the SourceDBClusterIdentifier parameter is also specified.   For the limitations of Oracle read replicas, see Version and licensing considerations for RDS for Oracle replicas in the Amazon RDS User Guide.   For the limitations of SQL Server read replicas, see Read replica limitations with SQL Server in the Amazon RDS User Guide.   The specified DB instance must have automatic backups enabled, that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.   If the source DB instance is in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the read replica, specify a valid DB instance identifier.   If the source DB instance is in a different Amazon Web Services Region from the read replica, specify a valid DB instance ARN. For more information, see Constructing an ARN for Amazon RDS in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This doesn't apply to SQL Server or RDS Custom, which don't support cross-Region replicas.
    ///   - storageThroughput: Specifies the storage throughput value for the read replica. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora DB instances.
    ///   - storageType: The storage type to associate with the read replica. If you specify io1, io2, or gp3, you must also include a value for the Iops parameter. Valid Values: gp2 | gp3 | io1 | io2 | standard  Default: io1 if the Iops parameter is specified. Otherwise, gp2.

    ///   - engine: The target Oracle DB engine when you convert a non-CDB to a CDB. This intermediate step is necessary to upgrade an Oracle Database 19c non-CDB to an Oracle Database 21c CDB. Note the following requirements:   Make sure that you specify oracle-ee-cdb or oracle-se2-cdb.   Make sure that your DB engine runs Oracle Database 19c with an April 2021 or later RU.   Note the following limitations:   You can't convert a CDB to a non-CDB.   You can't convert a replica database.   You can't convert a non-CDB to a CDB and upgrade the engine version in the same command.   You can't convert the existing custom parameter or option group when it has options or parameters that are permanent or persistent. In this situation, the DB instance reverts to the default option and parameter group. To avoid reverting to the default, specify a new parameter group with --db-parameter-group-name and a new option group with --option-group-name.
    ///   - engineVersion: The version number of the database engine to upgrade to.  Changing this parameter results in an outage and the change  is applied during the next maintenance window unless the ApplyImmediately parameter is enabled for this request. For major version upgrades, if a nondefault DB parameter group is currently in use, a new DB parameter group in the DB parameter group family for the new engine version must be specified. The new DB parameter group can be the default for that DB parameter group family. If you specify only a major version, Amazon RDS updates the DB instance to the  default minor version if the current minor version is lower. For information about valid engine versions, see CreateDBInstance,  or call DescribeDBEngineVersions. If the instance that you're modifying is acting as a read replica, the engine version that you specify must be the same or higher than the version that the source DB instance or cluster is running. In RDS Custom for Oracle, this parameter is supported for read replicas only if they are in the  PATCH_DB_FAILURE lifecycle. Constraints:   If you are upgrading the engine version and modifying the DB instance class at the same time, the currently running engine version must be supported on the  specified DB instance class. Otherwise, the operation returns an error. In this case, first run the operation to upgrade the engine version,  and then run it again to modify the DB instance class.
    ///   - iops: The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value for the RDS instance. Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the ApplyImmediately parameter is enabled for this request. If you are migrating from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, set this value to 0.  The DB instance will require a reboot for the change in storage type to take effect. If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to using standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the DB instance is available for use, but might experience performance degradation. While the migration takes place, nightly backups for the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can take place for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance. Constraints:   For RDS for MariaDB, RDS for MySQL, RDS for Oracle, and RDS for PostgreSQL - The value supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value.  Values that are not at least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value.   When you increase the Provisioned IOPS, you must also specify the AllocatedStorage parameter. You can use the current value for AllocatedStorage.   Default: Uses existing setting
    ///   - licenseModel: The license model for the DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values:   RDS for Db2 - bring-your-own-license    RDS for MariaDB - general-public-license    RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - license-included    RDS for MySQL - general-public-license    RDS for Oracle - bring-your-own-license | license-included    RDS for PostgreSQL - postgresql-license
    ///   - manageMasterUserPassword: Specifies whether to manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If the DB instance doesn't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can turn  on this management. In this case, you can't specify MasterUserPassword. If the DB instance already manages the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, and you specify that the  master user password is not managed with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager, then you must specify MasterUserPassword.  In this case, Amazon RDS deletes the secret and uses the new password for the master user specified by  MasterUserPassword. For more information, see Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager  in the Amazon RDS User Guide.  Constraints:   Can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager if MasterUserPassword  is specified.
    ///   - masterUserPassword: The new password for the master user. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.  Between the time of the request and the completion of the request, the MasterUserPassword element exists in the PendingModifiedValues element of the operation response.  Amazon RDS API operations never return the password,  so this operation provides a way to regain access to a primary instance user if the password is lost.  This includes restoring privileges that might have been accidentally revoked.  This setting doesn't apply to the following DB instances:   Amazon Aurora (The password for the master user is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see ModifyDBCluster.)   RDS Custom   Default: Uses existing setting Constraints:   Can't be specified if ManageMasterUserPassword is turned on.   Can include any printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@". For RDS for Oracle, can't include the "&" (ampersand) or  the "'" (single quotes) character.   Length Constraints:   RDS for Db2 - Must contain from 8 to 255 characters.   RDS for MariaDB - Must contain from 8 to 41 characters.   RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - Must contain from 8 to 128 characters.   RDS for MySQL - Must contain from 8 to 41 characters.   RDS for Oracle - Must contain from 8 to 30 characters.   RDS for PostgreSQL - Must contain from 8 to 128 characters.
    ///   - masterUserSecretKmsKeyId: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret that is automatically generated and  managed in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. This setting is valid only if both of the following conditions are met:   The DB instance doesn't manage the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If the DB instance already manages the master user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager,  you can't change the KMS key used to encrypt the secret.   You are turning on ManageMasterUserPassword to manage the master user password  in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If you are turning on ManageMasterUserPassword and don't specify  MasterUserSecretKmsKeyId, then the aws/secretsmanager  KMS key is used to encrypt the secret. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account, then you can't  use the aws/secretsmanager KMS key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer  managed KMS key.   The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.
    ///   - maxAllocatedStorage: The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automatically scale the storage of the DB instance. For more information about this setting, including limitations that apply to it, see   Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS storage autoscaling  in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - monitoringInterval: The interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring metrics are collected for  the DB instance. To disable collection of Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. If MonitoringRoleArn is specified, set MonitoringInterval to a value other than 0. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values: 0 | 1 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 30 | 60  Default: 0
    ///   - monitoringRoleArn: The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. For example, arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess. For information on creating a monitoring role, see To  create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide.  If MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, supply a MonitoringRoleArn  value. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - multiAZ: Specifies whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. Changing this parameter doesn't result  in an outage. The change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the ApplyImmediately  parameter is enabled for this request. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - multiTenant: Specifies whether the to convert your DB instance from the single-tenant conﬁguration to the multi-tenant conﬁguration. This parameter is supported only for RDS for Oracle CDB instances. During the conversion, RDS creates an initial tenant database and associates the DB name, master user name, character set, and national character set metadata with this database. The tags associated with the instance also propagate to the initial tenant database. You can add more tenant databases to your DB instance by using the CreateTenantDatabase operation.  The conversion to the multi-tenant configuration is permanent and irreversible, so you can't later convert back to the single-tenant configuration. When you specify this parameter, you must also specify ApplyImmediately.
    ///   - networkType: The network type of the DB instance. The network type is determined by the DBSubnetGroup specified for the DB instance.  A DBSubnetGroup can support only the IPv4 protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6  protocols (DUAL). For more information, see  Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the  Amazon RDS User Guide.  Valid Values: IPV4 | DUAL
    ///   - newDBInstanceIdentifier: The new identifier for the DB instance when renaming a DB instance. When you change the DB instance  identifier, an instance reboot occurs immediately if you enable ApplyImmediately, or will occur  during the next maintenance window if you disable ApplyImmediately. This value is stored as a lowercase string. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Constraints:   Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.   The first character must be a letter.   Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.   Example: mydbinstance
    ///   - optionGroupName: The option group to associate the DB instance with. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, with one exception. If the parameter change results  in an option group that enables OEM, it can cause a brief period, lasting less than a second, during which  new connections are rejected but existing connections aren't interrupted. The change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the ApplyImmediately parameter  is enabled for this request. Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Security TDE, can't be removed  from an option group, and that option group can't be removed from a DB instance after  it is associated with a DB instance. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - performanceInsightsKMSKeyId: The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Performance Insights data. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. If you don't specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId, then Amazon RDS  uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account.  Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - performanceInsightsRetentionPeriod: The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Valid Values:    7     month * 31, where month is a number of months from 1-23.  Examples: 93 (3 months * 31), 341 (11 months * 31), 589 (19 months * 31)    731    Default: 7 days If you specify a retention period that isn't valid, such as 94,  Amazon RDS returns an error.
    ///   - preferredBackupWindow: The daily time range during which automated backups are created if automated backups are enabled, as determined by the BackupRetentionPeriod parameter.  Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. The default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region. For more information, see Backup window in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora DB instances. The daily time range for creating automated backups is managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see ModifyDBCluster. Constraints:   Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi.   Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).   Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window.   Must be at least 30 minutes.
    ///   - preferredMaintenanceWindow: The weekly time range during which system maintenance can occur, which might result in an outage. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, except in the following situation, and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If there are pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window is changed to include the current time, then changing this parameter causes a reboot of the DB instance. If you change this window to the current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the current time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are applied.

    ///   - promotionTier: The order of priority in which an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance  after a failure of the existing primary instance. For more information,  see  Fault Tolerance for an Aurora DB Cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances. Default: 1  Valid Values: 0 - 15
    ///   - publiclyAccessible: Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible. When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from outside of the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC),  its Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP address. When you connect from within the same VPC as the DB instance,  the endpoint resolves to the private IP address. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't permit it. When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.  PubliclyAccessible only applies to DB instances in a VPC. The DB instance must be part of a  public subnet and PubliclyAccessible must be enabled for it to be publicly accessible. Changes to the PubliclyAccessible parameter are applied immediately regardless of the value of the ApplyImmediately parameter.
    ///   - replicaMode: A value that sets the open mode of a replica database to either mounted or read-only.  Currently, this parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances.  Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Enterprise Edition. The main use case for  mounted replicas is cross-Region disaster recovery. The primary database doesn't use  Active Data Guard to transmit information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't  accept user connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload.  For more information, see Working with Oracle Read Replicas for Amazon RDS  in the Amazon RDS User Guide. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - resumeFullAutomationModeMinutes: The number of minutes to pause the automation. When the time period ends, RDS Custom resumes  full automation. Default: 60  Constraints:   Must be at least 60.   Must be no more than 1,440.
    ///   - rotateMasterUserPassword: Specifies whether to rotate the secret managed by Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the  master user password. This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by RDS in Amazon Web Services Secrets  Manager for the DB cluster. The secret value contains the updated password. For more information, see Password management with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager  in the Amazon RDS User Guide.  Constraints:   You must apply the change immediately when rotating the master user password.
    ///   - storageThroughput: The storage throughput value for the DB instance. This setting applies only to the gp3 storage type. This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB instances.
    ///   - storageType: The storage type to associate with the DB instance. If you specify io1, io2, or gp3  you must also include a value for the Iops parameter. If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard storage to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to using standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the migration depends on several factors such as database load, storage size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS), amount of IOPS provisioned (if any), and the number of prior scale storage operations. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but the process can take up to several days in some cases.

At least one parameter name, value, and  application method must be supplied; later arguments are optional. A maximum of 20 parameters can be modified in a single request. Valid Values (for the application method): immediate | pending-reboot  You can use the immediate value with dynamic parameters only. You can use the pending-reboot value for both dynamic  and static parameters. When the application method is immediate, changes to dynamic parameters are applied immediately to the DB instances associated with  the parameter group. When the application method is pending-reboot, changes to dynamic and static parameters are applied after a reboot without failover  to the DB instances associated with the parameter group.  You can't use pending-reboot with dynamic parameters on RDS for SQL Server DB instances. Use immediate.

    /// Restores a DB cluster to an arbitrary point in time. Users can restore to any point in time before LatestRestorableTime for up to BackupRetentionPeriod days. The target DB cluster is created from the source DB cluster with the same configuration as the original DB cluster, except that the new DB cluster is created with the default DB security group.  For Aurora, this operation only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for that DB cluster. You must invoke the CreateDBInstance operation to create DB instances for the restored DB cluster, specifying the identifier of the restored DB cluster in DBClusterIdentifier. You can create DB instances only after the RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime operation has completed and the DB cluster is available.

By default, the public snapshots are not included. You can share a manual DB snapshot as public by using the ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute API. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
    ///   - includeShared: Specifies whether to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots  from other Amazon Web Services accounts that this Amazon Web Services account has been given  permission to copy or restore. By default, these snapshots are not included. You can give an Amazon Web Services account permission to restore a manual DB snapshot from another Amazon Web Services account by using the ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute API action. This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
    ///   - maxRecords: The maximum number of records to include in the response. If more records exist than the specified MaxRecords value, a pagination token called a marker is included in the response so that you can retrieve the remaining results. Default: 100 Constraints: Minimum 20, maximum 100.
    ///   - snapshotType: The type of snapshots to be returned. You can specify one of the following values:    automated - Return all DB snapshots that have been automatically taken by  Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.    manual - Return all DB snapshots that have been taken by my Amazon Web Services account.    shared - Return all manual DB snapshots that have been shared to my Amazon Web Services account.    public - Return all DB snapshots that have been marked as public.    awsbackup - Return the DB snapshots managed by the Amazon Web Services Backup service. For information about Amazon Web Services Backup, see the   Amazon Web Services Backup Developer Guide.   The awsbackup type does not apply to Aurora.   If you don't specify a SnapshotType value, then both automated and manual snapshots are returned. Shared and public DB snapshots are not included in the returned results by default. You can include shared snapshots with these results by enabling the IncludeShared parameter. You can include public snapshots with these results by enabling the  IncludePublic parameter. The IncludeShared and IncludePublic parameters don't apply for SnapshotType values of manual or automated. The IncludePublic parameter doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to shared. The IncludeShared parameter doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to public.
