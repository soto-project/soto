Amazon Forecast creates predictors with AutoPredictor, which involves applying the optimal combination of algorithms to each time series in your datasets. You can use CreateAutoPredictor to create new predictors or upgrade/retrain existing predictors.  Creating new predictors  The following parameters are required when creating a new predictor:    PredictorName - A unique name for the predictor.    DatasetGroupArn - The ARN of the dataset group used to train the predictor.    ForecastFrequency - The granularity of your forecasts (hourly, daily, weekly, etc).    ForecastHorizon - The number of time-steps that the model predicts. The forecast horizon is also called the prediction length.   When creating a new predictor, do not specify a value for ReferencePredictorArn.  Upgrading and retraining predictors  The following parameters are required when retraining or upgrading a predictor:    PredictorName - A unique name for the predictor.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - dataConfig: The data configuration for your dataset group and any additional datasets.
    ///   - encryptionConfig: 
    ///   - explainPredictor: Create an Explainability resource for the predictor.
    ///   - forecastDimensions: An array of dimension (field) names that specify how to group the generated forecast. For example, if you are generating forecasts for item sales across all your stores, and your dataset contains a store_id field, you would specify store_id as a dimension to group sales forecasts for each store.
    ///   - forecastFrequency: The frequency of predictions in a forecast. Valid intervals are an integer followed by Y (Year), M (Month), W (Week), D (Day), H (Hour), and min (Minute). For example, "1D" indicates every day and "15min" indicates every 15 minutes. You cannot specify a value that would overlap with the next larger frequency. That means, for example, you cannot specify a frequency of 60 minutes, because that is equivalent to 1 hour. The valid values for each frequency are the following:   Minute - 1-59   Hour - 1-23   Day - 1-6   Week - 1-4   Month - 1-11   Year - 1   Thus, if you want every other week forecasts, specify "2W". Or, if you want quarterly forecasts, you specify "3M". The frequency must be greater than or equal to the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset frequency. When a RELATED_TIME_SERIES dataset is provided, the frequency must be equal to the RELATED_TIME_SERIES dataset frequency.
    ///   - forecastHorizon: The number of time-steps that the model predicts. The forecast horizon is also called the prediction length. The maximum forecast horizon is the lesser of 500 time-steps or 1/4 of the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset length. If you are retraining an existing AutoPredictor, then the maximum forecast horizon is the lesser of 500 time-steps or 1/3 of the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset length. If you are upgrading to an AutoPredictor or retraining an existing AutoPredictor, you cannot update the forecast horizon parameter. You can meet this requirement by providing longer time-series in the dataset.
    ///   - forecastTypes: The forecast types used to train a predictor. You can specify up to five forecast types. Forecast types can be quantiles from 0.01 to 0.99, by increments of 0.01 or higher. You can also specify the mean forecast with mean.
    ///   - monitorConfig: The configuration details for predictor monitoring. Provide a name for the monitor resource to enable predictor monitoring. Predictor monitoring allows you to see how your predictor's performance changes over time. For more information, see Predictor Monitoring.
    ///   - optimizationMetric: The accuracy metric used to optimize the predictor.
    ///   - predictorName: A unique name for the predictor
    ///   - referencePredictorArn: The ARN of the predictor to retrain or upgrade. This parameter is only used when retraining or upgrading a predictor. When creating a new predictor, do not specify a value for this parameter. When upgrading or retraining a predictor, only specify values for the ReferencePredictorArn and PredictorName. The value for PredictorName must be a unique predictor name.
    ///   - tags: Optional metadata to help you categorize and organize your predictors. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tag keys and values are case sensitive. The following restrictions apply to tags:   For each resource, each tag key must be unique and each tag key must have one value.   Maximum number of tags per resource: 50.   Maximum key length: 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.   Maximum value length: 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.   Accepted characters: all letters and numbers, spaces representable in UTF-8, and + - = . _ : / @. If your tagging schema is used across other services and resources, the character restrictions of those services also apply.    Key prefixes cannot include any upper or lowercase combination of aws: or AWS:. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix.
    ///   - timeAlignmentBoundary: The time boundary Forecast uses to align and aggregate any data that doesn't align with your forecast frequency. Provide the unit of time and the time boundary as a key value pair.  For more information on specifying a time boundary, see Specifying a Time Boundary. If you don't provide a time boundary, Forecast uses a set of Default Time Boundaries.

In the request, provide a dataset group and either specify an algorithm or let Amazon Forecast choose an algorithm for you using AutoML. If you specify an algorithm, you also can override algorithm-specific hyperparameters. Amazon Forecast uses the algorithm to train a predictor using the latest version of the datasets in the specified dataset group. You can then generate a forecast using the CreateForecast operation. To see the evaluation metrics, use the GetAccuracyMetrics operation.  You can specify a featurization configuration to fill and aggregate the data fields in the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset to improve model training. For more information, see FeaturizationConfig. For RELATED_TIME_SERIES datasets, CreatePredictor verifies that the DataFrequency specified when the dataset was created matches the ForecastFrequency. TARGET_TIME_SERIES datasets don't have this restriction. Amazon Forecast also verifies the delimiter and timestamp format. For more information, see howitworks-datasets-groups. By default, predictors are trained and evaluated at the 0.1 (P10), 0.5 (P50), and 0.9 (P90) quantiles. You can choose custom forecast types to train and evaluate your predictor by setting the ForecastTypes.   AutoML  If you want Amazon Forecast to evaluate each algorithm and choose the one that minimizes the objective function, set PerformAutoML to true. The objective function is defined as the mean of the weighted losses over the forecast types. By default, these are the p10, p50, and p90 quantile losses. For more information, see EvaluationResult.

Supported algorithms:     arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/ARIMA     arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/CNN-QR     arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/Deep_AR_Plus     arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/ETS     arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/NPTS     arn:aws:forecast:::algorithm/Prophet
    ///   - autoMLOverrideStrategy:  The LatencyOptimized AutoML override strategy is only available in private beta. Contact Amazon Web Services Support or your account manager to learn more about access privileges.   Used to overide the default AutoML strategy, which is to optimize predictor accuracy. To apply an AutoML strategy that minimizes training time, use LatencyOptimized. This parameter is only valid for predictors trained using AutoML.
    ///   - encryptionConfig: An Key Management Service (KMS) key and the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon Forecast can assume to access the key.
    ///   - evaluationParameters: Used to override the default evaluation parameters of the specified algorithm. Amazon Forecast evaluates a predictor by splitting a dataset into training data and testing data. The evaluation parameters define how to perform the split and the number of iterations.
    ///   - featurizationConfig: The featurization configuration.
    ///   - forecastHorizon: Specifies the number of time-steps that the model is trained to predict. The forecast horizon is also called the prediction length. For example, if you configure a dataset for daily data collection (using the DataFrequency parameter of the CreateDataset operation) and set the forecast horizon to 10, the model returns predictions for 10 days. The maximum forecast horizon is the lesser of 500 time-steps or 1/3 of the TARGET_TIME_SERIES dataset length.
    ///   - forecastTypes: Specifies the forecast types used to train a predictor. You can specify up to five forecast types. Forecast types can be quantiles from 0.01 to 0.99, by increments of 0.01 or higher. You can also specify the mean forecast with mean.  The default value is ["0.10", "0.50", "0.9"].
    ///   - hpoConfig: Provides hyperparameter override values for the algorithm. If you don't provide this parameter, Amazon Forecast uses default values. The individual algorithms specify which hyperparameters support hyperparameter optimization (HPO). For more information, see aws-forecast-choosing-recipes. If you included the HPOConfig object, you must set PerformHPO to true.
    ///   - inputDataConfig: Describes the dataset group that contains the data to use to train the predictor.
    ///   - optimizationMetric: The accuracy metric used to optimize the predictor.
    ///   - performAutoML: Whether to perform AutoML. When Amazon Forecast performs AutoML, it evaluates the algorithms it provides and chooses the best algorithm and configuration for your training dataset. The default value is false. In this case, you are required to specify an algorithm. Set PerformAutoML to true to have Amazon Forecast perform AutoML. This is a good option if you aren't sure which algorithm is suitable for your training data. In this case, PerformHPO must be false.
    ///   - performHPO: Whether to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO). HPO finds optimal hyperparameter values for your training data. The process of performing HPO is known as running a hyperparameter tuning job. The default value is false. In this case, Amazon Forecast uses default hyperparameter values from the chosen algorithm. To override the default values, set PerformHPO to true and, optionally, supply the HyperParameterTuningJobConfig object. The tuning job specifies a metric to optimize, which hyperparameters participate in tuning, and the valid range for each tunable hyperparameter. In this case, you are required to specify an algorithm and PerformAutoML must be false. The following algorithms support HPO:   DeepAR+   CNN-QR
    ///   - predictorName: A name for the predictor.
    ///   - tags: The optional metadata that you apply to the predictor to help you categorize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per resource - 50.   For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value.   Maximum key length - 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8.   Maximum value length - 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.   If your tagging schema is used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services may have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, numbers, and spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @.   Tag keys and values are case sensitive.   Do not use aws:, AWS:, or any upper or lowercase combination of such as a prefix for keys as it is reserved for Amazon Web Services use. You cannot edit or delete tag keys with this prefix. Values can have this prefix. If a tag value has aws as its prefix but the key does not, then Forecast considers it to be a user tag and will count against the limit of 50 tags. Tags with only the key prefix of aws do not count against your tags per resource limit.

    ///   - filters: An array of filters. For each filter, you provide a condition and a match statement. The condition is either IS or IS_NOT, which specifies whether to include or exclude the what-if forecast export jobs that match the statement from the list, respectively. The match statement consists of a key and a value.  Filter properties     Condition - The condition to apply. Valid values are IS and IS_NOT. To include the forecast export jobs that match the statement, specify IS. To exclude matching forecast export jobs, specify IS_NOT.    Key - The name of the parameter to filter on. Valid values are WhatIfForecastArn and Status.    Value - The value to match.   For example, to list all jobs that export a forecast named electricityWhatIfForecast, specify the following filter:  "Filters": [ { "Condition": "IS", "Key": "WhatIfForecastArn", "Value": "arn:aws:forecast:us-west-2::forecast/electricityWhatIfForecast" } ]
