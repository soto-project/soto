/// Service object for interacting with AWS CognitoIdentity service.

/// Amazon Cognito Federated Identities Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the lifetime of an application. Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider trusted by Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege Amazon Web Services credentials. For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide see Authentication Flow. For more information see Amazon Cognito Federated Identities.

A tag is a label that you can use to categorize and manage identity pools in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. Each tag consists of a key and value, both of which you define. A key is a general category for more specific values. For example, if you have two versions of an identity pool, one for testing and another for production, you might assign an Environment tag key to both identity pools. The value of this key might be Test for one identity pool and Production for the other. Tags are useful for cost tracking and access control. You can activate your tags so that they appear on the Billing and Cost Management console, where you can track the costs associated with your identity pools. In an IAM policy, you can constrain permissions for identity pools based on specific tags or tag values. You can use this action up to 5 times per second, per account. An identity pool can have as many as 50 tags.
