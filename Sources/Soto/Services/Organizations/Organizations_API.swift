/// Service object for interacting with AWS Organizations service.
///
/// AWS Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple AWS accounts into an organization and centrally manage your accounts and their resources. This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations operations. For more information about using this service, see the AWS Organizations User Guide.  Support and feedback for AWS Organizations  We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com or post your feedback and questions in the AWS Organizations support forum. For more information about the AWS support forums, see Forums Help.  Endpoint to call When using the AWS CLI or the AWS SDK  For the current release of Organizations, specify the us-east-1 region for all AWS API and AWS CLI calls made from the commercial AWS Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the AWS Regions in China, then specify cn-northwest-1. You can do this in the AWS CLI by using these parameters and commands:   Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its region:  --endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (from commercial AWS Regions outside of China)  or  --endpoint-url https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn (from AWS Regions in China)    Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command:  aws configure set default.region us-east-1 (from commercial AWS Regions outside of China)  or  aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1 (from AWS Regions in China)    Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint:  --region us-east-1 (from commercial AWS Regions outside of China)  or  --region cn-northwest-1 (from AWS Regions in China)     Recording API Requests  AWS Organizations supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by AWS CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the Organizations service received, who made the request and when, and so on. For more about AWS Organizations and its support for AWS CloudTrail, see Logging AWS Organizations Events with AWS CloudTrail in the AWS Organizations User Guide. To learn more about AWS CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.

The user who calls the API for an invitation to join must have the organizations:AcceptHandshake permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, the user must also have the iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission so that AWS Organizations can create the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User Guide.

You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:   Use the Id member of the CreateAccountStatus response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.   Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with AWS Organizations, see Logging and monitoring in AWS Organizations in the AWS Organizations User Guide.    The user who calls the API to create an account must have the organizations:CreateAccount permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, AWS Organizations creates the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User Guide. If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organizations:TagResource permission. AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named OrganizationAccountAccessRole by default) that grants users in the management account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the management account can assume the role. AWS Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization's management account. This operation can be called only from the organization's management account. For more information about creating accounts, see Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is not automatically collected. If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at  To leave an organization as a member account in the AWS Organizations User Guide.   If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact AWS Support.   If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact AWS Support.   Using CreateAccount to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost Management Console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see Closing an AWS Account in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an account, see Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools.

    /// This action is available if all of the following are true:   You're authorized to create accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region. For more information on the AWS GovCloud (US) Region, see the  AWS GovCloud User Guide.    You already have an account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region that is paired with a management account of an organization in the commercial Region.   You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region.   You have the organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount permission.    AWS Organizations automatically creates the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User Guide.  AWS automatically enables AWS CloudTrail for AWS GovCloud (US) accounts, but you should also do the following:   Verify that AWS CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.   Create an S3 bucket for AWS CloudTrail log storage. For more information, see Verifying AWS CloudTrail Is Enabled in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.    If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organizations:TagResource permission. The tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the TagResource operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account exists. You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone AWS account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see AWS Organizations in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.  Calling CreateGovCloudAccount is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. Because CreateGovCloudAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:   Use the OperationId response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.   Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For information on using AWS CloudTrail with Organizations, see Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     When you call the CreateGovCloudAccount action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address. A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An AWS GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new AWS GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the AWS GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that explains how account access works, see AWS Organizations in the AWS GovCloud User Guide.  For more information about creating accounts, see Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.     When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account is not automatically collected. This includes a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA).

The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up from AWS Organizations.  We  strongly recommend  that you don't use this command to disable integration between AWS Organizations and the specified AWS service. Instead, use the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. This lets the trusted service perform any required initialization when enabling trusted access, such as creating any required resources and any required clean up of resources when disabling trusted access.  For information about how to disable trusted service access to your organization using the trusted service, see the Learn more link under the Supports Trusted Access column at AWS services that you can use with AWS Organizations. on this page. If you disable access by using this command, it causes the following actions to occur:   The service can no longer create a service-linked role in the accounts in your organization. This means that the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up from AWS Organizations.    The service can no longer perform tasks in the member accounts in the organization, unless those operations are explicitly permitted by the IAM policies that are attached to your roles. This includes any data aggregation from the member accounts to the management account, or to a delegated administrator account, where relevant.   Some services detect this and clean up any remaining data or resources related to the integration, while other services stop accessing the organization but leave any historical data and configuration in place to support a possible re-enabling of the integration.   Using the other service's console or commands to disable the integration ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up any resources that are required only for the integration. How the service cleans up its resources in the organization's accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other AWS service.   After you perform the DisableAWSServiceAccess operation, the specified service can no longer perform operations in your organization's accounts  For more information about integrating other services with AWS Organizations, including the list of services that work with Organizations, see Integrating AWS Organizations with Other AWS Services in the AWS Organizations User Guide.
