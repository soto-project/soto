/// Service object for interacting with AWS Organizations service.
///
/// Organizations is a web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple Amazon Web Services accounts into an organization and centrally manage your accounts and their resources. This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations operations. For more information about using this service, see the Organizations User Guide.  Support and feedback for Organizations  We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com or post your feedback and questions in the Organizations support forum. For more information about the Amazon Web Services support forums, see Forums Help.  Endpoint to call When using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDK  For the current release of Organizations, specify the us-east-1 region for all Amazon Web Services API and CLI calls made from the commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the Amazon Web Services Regions in China, then specify cn-northwest-1. You can do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:   Use the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its region:  --endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)  or  --endpoint-url https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn (from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)    Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with this command:  aws configure set default.region us-east-1 (from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)  or  aws configure set default.region cn-northwest-1 (from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)    Use the following parameter with each command to specify the endpoint:  --region us-east-1 (from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China)  or  --region cn-northwest-1 (from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)     Recording API Requests  Organizations supports CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the Organizations service received, who made the request and when, and so on. For more about Organizations and its support for CloudTrail, see Logging Organizations Events with CloudTrail in the Organizations User Guide. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the CloudTrail User Guide.

This operation can be called only by the following principals when they also have the relevant IAM permissions:    Invitation to join or Approve all features request handshakes: only a principal from the member account. The user who calls the API for an invitation to join must have the organizations:AcceptHandshake permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, the user must also have the iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission so that Organizations can create the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the Organizations User Guide.    Enable all features final confirmation handshake: only a principal from the management account. For more information about invitations, see Inviting an Amazon Web Services account to join your organization in the Organizations User Guide. For more information about requests to enable all features in the organization, see Enabling all features in your organization in the Organizations User Guide.    After you accept a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days. After that, it's deleted.

    /// Closes an Amazon Web Services member account within an organization. You can't close the management account with this API. This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because CloseAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account closure might still be in progress. You need to wait a few minutes before the account is fully closed. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:   Use the AccountId that you sent in the CloseAccount request to provide as a parameter to the DescribeAccount operation.  While the close account request is in progress, Account status will indicate PENDING_CLOSURE. When the close account request completes, the status will change to SUSPENDED.    Check the CloudTrail log for the CloseAccountResult event that gets published after the account closes successfully. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see Logging and monitoring in Organizations in the Organizations User Guide.       You can only close 10% of active member accounts within a rolling 30 day period. This quota is not bound by a calendar month, but starts when you close an account. Within 30 days of that initial account closure, you can't exceed the 10% account closure limit.   To reinstate a closed account, contact Amazon Web Services Support within the 90-day grace period while the account is in SUSPENDED status.    If the Amazon Web Services account you attempt to close is linked to an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account, the CloseAccount request will close both accounts. To learn important pre-closure details, see  Closing an Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account in the  Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.    For more information about closing accounts, see Closing an Amazon Web Services account in the Organizations User Guide.

    /// Creates an Amazon Web Services account that is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. This is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because CreateAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:   Use the Id member of the CreateAccountStatus response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.   Check the CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see Logging and monitoring in Organizations in the Organizations User Guide.    The user who calls the API to create an account must have the organizations:CreateAccount permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, Organizations creates the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the Organizations User Guide. If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organizations:TagResource permission. Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named OrganizationAccountAccessRole by default) that grants users in the management account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the management account can assume the role. Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization's management account. This operation can be called only from the organization's management account. For more information about creating accounts, see Creating an Amazon Web Services account in Your Organization in the Organizations User Guide.     When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account, such as a payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA) is not automatically collected. If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. Follow the steps at  To leave an organization as a member account in the Organizations User Guide.   If you get an exception that indicates that you exceeded your account limits for the organization, contact Amazon Web Services Support.   If you get an exception that indicates that the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact Amazon Web Services Support.   Using CreateAccount to create multiple temporary accounts isn't recommended. You can only close an account from the Billing and Cost Management console, and you must be signed in as the root user. For information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see Closing an Amazon Web Services account in the Organizations User Guide.     When you create a member account with this operation, you can choose whether to create the account with the IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information switch enabled. If you enable it, IAM users and roles that have appropriate permissions can view billing information for the account. If you disable it, only the account root user can access billing information. For information about how to disable this switch for an account, see Granting Access to Your Billing Information and Tools.
    public func createAccount(_ input: CreateAccountRequest, logger: Logger = AWSClient.loggingDisabled, on eventLoop: EventLoop? = nil) -> EventLoopFuture<CreateAccountResponse> {

    }

    /// This action is available if all of the following are true:   You're authorized to create accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. For more information on the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region, see the  Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.    You already have an account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region that is paired with a management account of an organization in the commercial Region.   You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region.   You have the organizations:CreateGovCloudAccount permission.    Organizations automatically creates the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations. For more information, see Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the Organizations User Guide.  Amazon Web Services automatically enables CloudTrail for Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) accounts, but you should also do the following:   Verify that CloudTrail is enabled to store logs.   Create an Amazon S3 bucket for CloudTrail log storage. For more information, see Verifying CloudTrail Is Enabled in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.    If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the organizations:TagResource permission. The tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the TagResource operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account exists. You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone Amazon Web Services account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see Organizations in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.  Calling CreateGovCloudAccount is an asynchronous request that Amazon Web Services performs in the background. Because CreateGovCloudAccount operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:   Use the OperationId response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the DescribeCreateAccountStatus operation.   Check the CloudTrail log for the CreateAccountResult event. For information on using CloudTrail with Organizations, see Monitoring the Activity in Your Organization in the Organizations User Guide.     When you call the CreateGovCloudAccount action, you create two accounts: a standalone account in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address. A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization. For more information and to view a diagram that explains how account access works, see Organizations in the Amazon Web Services GovCloud User Guide.    For more information about creating accounts, see Creating an Amazon Web Services account in Your Organization in the Organizations User Guide.     When you create an account in an organization using the Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account is not automatically collected.

The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up from Organizations.  We  strongly recommend that you don't use this command to disable integration between Organizations and the specified Amazon Web Services service. Instead, use the console or commands that are provided by the specified service. This lets the trusted service perform any required initialization when enabling trusted access, such as creating any required resources and any required clean up of resources when disabling trusted access.  For information about how to disable trusted service access to your organization using the trusted service, see the Learn more link under the Supports Trusted Access column at Amazon Web Services services that you can use with Organizations. on this page. If you disable access by using this command, it causes the following actions to occur:   The service can no longer create a service-linked role in the accounts in your organization. This means that the service can't perform operations on your behalf on any new accounts in your organization. The service can still perform operations in older accounts until the service completes its clean-up from Organizations.    The service can no longer perform tasks in the member accounts in the organization, unless those operations are explicitly permitted by the IAM policies that are attached to your roles. This includes any data aggregation from the member accounts to the management account, or to a delegated administrator account, where relevant.   Some services detect this and clean up any remaining data or resources related to the integration, while other services stop accessing the organization but leave any historical data and configuration in place to support a possible re-enabling of the integration.   Using the other service's console or commands to disable the integration ensures that the other service is aware that it can clean up any resources that are required only for the integration. How the service cleans up its resources in the organization's accounts depends on that service. For more information, see the documentation for the other Amazon Web Services service.
