/// Amazon Simple Workflow Service The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and  concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application. Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state. This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the Amazon SWF programming model, see the  Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

If a runId isn't specified, then the WorkflowExecutionTerminated event is recorded in the history of the current open workflow with the matching workflowId in the domain.   You should consider using RequestCancelWorkflowExecution action instead because it allows the workflow to gracefully close while TerminateWorkflowExecution doesn't.   Access Control  You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF resources as follows:   Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit the action to only specified domains.   Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to call this action.   You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.   If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED.
