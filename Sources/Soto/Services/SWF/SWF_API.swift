/// Service object for interacting with AWS SWF service.

/// Amazon Simple Workflow Service The Amazon Simple Workflow Service (Amazon SWF) makes it easy to build applications that use Amazon's cloud to coordinate work across distributed components. In Amazon SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application. Amazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state. This documentation serves as reference only. For a broader overview of the Amazon SWF programming model, see the  Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

The worker can also specify details of the progress, for example percent complete, using the details parameter. This action can also be used by the worker as a mechanism to check if cancellation is being requested for the activity task. If a cancellation is being attempted for the specified task, then the boolean cancelRequested flag returned by the service is set to true. This action resets the taskHeartbeatTimeout clock. The taskHeartbeatTimeout is specified in RegisterActivityType. This action doesn't in itself create an event in the workflow execution history. However, if the task times out, the workflow execution history contains a ActivityTaskTimedOut event that contains the information from the last heartbeat generated by the activity worker.  The taskStartToCloseTimeout of an activity type is the maximum duration of an activity task, regardless of the number of RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat requests received. The taskStartToCloseTimeout is also specified in RegisterActivityType.   This operation is only useful for long-lived activities to report liveliness of the task and to determine if a cancellation is being attempted.   If the cancelRequested flag returns true, a cancellation is being attempted. If the worker can cancel the activity, it should respond with RespondActivityTaskCanceled. Otherwise, it should ignore the cancellation request.
