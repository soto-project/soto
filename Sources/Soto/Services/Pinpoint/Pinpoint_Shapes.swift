Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-push-type request header when it sends the notification message to APNs. If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value to alert or background automatically, based on the value that you specify for the SilentPush or RawContent property of the message. For more information about the apns-push-type request header, see Sending Notification Requests to APNs on the Apple Developer website.

If you're sending a silent (background) notification, set the value of content-available to 1. Additionally, silent notification payloads can't include the alert, badge, or sound keys.

You can use silent push notifications to make small updates to your app, or to display messages in an in-app message center. Amazon Pinpoint uses this property to determine the correct value for the apns-push-type request header when it sends the notification message to APNs.
