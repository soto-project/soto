    // MARK: Async API Calls

    /// Creates an activity. An activity is a task that you write in any programming language and host on any machine that has access to AWS Step Functions. Activities must poll Step Functions using the GetActivityTask API action and respond using SendTask* API actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the activity.  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.    CreateActivity is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. CreateActivity's idempotency check is based on the activity name. If a following request has different tags values, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, tags will not be updated, even if they are different.

    /// Creates a state machine. A state machine consists of a collection of states that can do work (Task states), determine to which states to transition next (Choice states), stop an execution with an error (Fail states), and so on. State machines are specified using a JSON-based, structured language. For more information, see Amazon States Language in the AWS Step Functions User Guide.   This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.    CreateStateMachine is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. CreateStateMachine's idempotency check is based on the state machine name, definition, type, LoggingConfiguration and TracingConfiguration. If a following request has a different roleArn or tags, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, roleArn and tags will not be updated, even if they are different.

This initiates a long poll, where the service holds the HTTP connection open and responds as soon as a task becomes available (i.e. an execution of a task of this type is needed.) The maximum time the service holds on to the request before responding is 60 seconds. If no task is available within 60 seconds, the poll returns a taskToken with a null string.  Workers should set their client side socket timeout to at least 65 seconds (5 seconds higher than the maximum time the service may hold the poll request).
