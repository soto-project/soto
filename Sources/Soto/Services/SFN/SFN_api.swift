/// Service object for interacting with AWS SFN service.
///
/// Step Functions Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the components of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows. You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual components, each of which performs a discrete function, or task, allowing you to scale and change applications quickly. Step Functions provides a console that helps visualize the components of your application as a series of steps. Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks each step, and retries steps when there are errors, so your application executes predictably and in the right order every time. Step Functions logs the state of each step, so you can quickly diagnose and debug any issues. Step Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to ensure your application is available at any scale. You can run tasks on Amazon Web Services, your own servers, or any system that has access to Amazon Web Services. You can access and use Step Functions using the console, the Amazon Web Services SDKs, or an HTTP API. For more information about Step Functions, see the  Step Functions Developer Guide .  If you use the Step Functions API actions using Amazon Web Services SDK integrations, make sure the API actions are in camel case and parameter names are in Pascal case. For example, you could use Step Functions API action startSyncExecution and specify its parameter as StateMachineArn.

    /// Creates an activity. An activity is a task that you write in any programming language and host on any machine that has access to Step Functions. Activities must poll Step Functions using the GetActivityTask API action and respond using SendTask* API actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the activity.  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.    CreateActivity is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. CreateActivity's idempotency check is based on the activity name. If a following request has different tags values, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, tags will not be updated, even if they are different.

    /// Creates a state machine. A state machine consists of a collection of states that can do work (Task states), determine to which states to transition next (Choice states), stop an execution with an error (Fail states), and so on. State machines are specified using a JSON-based, structured language. For more information, see Amazon States Language in the Step Functions User Guide. If you set the publish parameter of this API action to true, it publishes version 1 as the first revision of the state machine.  This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.    CreateStateMachine is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won’t create a duplicate resource if it was already created. CreateStateMachine's idempotency check is based on the state machine name, definition, type, LoggingConfiguration, and TracingConfiguration. The check is also based on the publish and versionDescription parameters. If a following request has a different roleArn or tags, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, roleArn and tags will not be updated, even if they are different.

You can set your application to call StartExecution with an alias and update the version the alias uses without changing the client's code. You can also map an alias to split StartExecution requests between two versions of a state machine. To do this, add a second RoutingConfig object in the routingConfiguration parameter. You must also specify the percentage of execution run requests each version should receive in both RoutingConfig objects. Step Functions randomly chooses which version runs a given execution based on the percentage you specify. To create an alias that points to a single version, specify a single RoutingConfig object with a weight set to 100. You can create up to 100 aliases for each state machine. You must delete unused aliases using the DeleteStateMachineAlias API action.  CreateStateMachineAlias is an idempotent API. Step Functions bases the idempotency check on the stateMachineArn, description, name, and routingConfiguration parameters. Requests that contain the same values for these parameters return a successful idempotent response without creating a duplicate resource.

When you redrive an execution, it continues the failed execution from the unsuccessful step and uses the same input. Step Functions preserves the results and execution history of the successful steps, and doesn't rerun these steps when you redrive an execution. Redriven executions use the same state machine definition and execution ARN as the original execution attempt. For workflows that include an Inline Map or Parallel state, RedriveExecution API action reschedules and redrives only the iterations and branches that failed or aborted. To redrive a workflow that includes a Distributed Map state whose Map Run failed, you must redrive the parent workflow. The parent workflow redrives all the unsuccessful states, including a failed Map Run. If a Map Run was not started in the original execution attempt, the redriven parent workflow starts the Map Run.  This API action is not supported by EXPRESS state machines. However, you can restart the unsuccessful executions of Express child workflows in a Distributed Map by redriving its Map Run. When you redrive a Map Run, the Express child workflows are rerun using the StartExecution API action. For more information, see Redriving Map Runs.  You can redrive executions if your original execution meets the following conditions:   The execution status isn't SUCCEEDED.   Your workflow execution has not exceeded the redrivable period of 14 days. Redrivable period refers to the time during which you can redrive a given execution. This period starts from the day a state machine completes its execution.   The workflow execution has not exceeded the maximum open time of one year. For more information about state machine quotas, see Quotas related to state machine executions.   The execution event history count is less than 24,999. Redriven executions append their event history to the existing event history. Make sure your workflow execution contains less than 24,999 events to accommodate the ExecutionRedriven history event and at least one other history event.
