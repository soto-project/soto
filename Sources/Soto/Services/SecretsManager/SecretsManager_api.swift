/// Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager provides a service to enable you to store, manage, and retrieve, secrets.  This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information about using this service, see the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide.   API Version   This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17.                 Support and Feedback for Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager  We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com, or post your feedback and questions in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Discussion Forum. For more information about the Amazon Web Services Discussion Forums, see Forums Help.   Logging API Requests  Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support for Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see Logging Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide. To learn more about CloudTrail, including enabling it and find your log files, see the Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User Guide.

    // MARK: API Calls

    /// Turns off automatic rotation, and if a rotation is currently in progress, cancels the rotation. If you cancel a rotation in progress, it can leave the VersionStage labels in an unexpected state. You might need to remove the staging label AWSPENDING from the partially created version.  You also need to determine whether to roll back to the previous version of the secret  by moving the staging label AWSCURRENT to the version that has AWSPENDING. To determine  which version has a specific staging label, call ListSecretVersionIds. Then use  UpdateSecretVersionStage to change staging labels.  For more information, see How rotation works. To turn on automatic rotation again, call RotateSecret. Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters because it might be logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail.  Required permissions:  secretsmanager:CancelRotateSecret.  For more information, see  IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager and Authentication  and access control in Secrets Manager.
    public func cancelRotateSecret(_ input: CancelRotateSecretRequest, logger: Logger = AWSClient.loggingDisabled, on eventLoop: EventLoop? = nil) -> EventLoopFuture<CancelRotateSecretResponse> {
        return self.client.execute(operation: "CancelRotateSecret", path: "/", httpMethod: .POST, serviceConfig: self.config, input: input, logger: logger, on: eventLoop)
    }

    /// Creates a new secret. A secret can be a password, a set of  credentials such as a user name and password, an OAuth token, or other secret information  that you store in an encrypted form in Secrets Manager. The secret also  includes the connection information to access a database or other service, which Secrets Manager  doesn't encrypt. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret. For information about creating a secret in the console, see Create a secret. To create a secret, you can provide the secret value to be encrypted in either the SecretString parameter or the SecretBinary parameter, but not both.  If you include SecretString or SecretBinary then Secrets Manager creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to it. For database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to be able to rotate the secret, you must make sure the JSON you store in the SecretString matches the JSON structure of a database secret. If you don't specify an KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed key  aws/secretsmanager. If this key  doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account automatically have access to use aws/secretsmanager.  Creating aws/secretsmanager can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the  result. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling the API, then  you can't use aws/secretsmanager to encrypt the secret, and you must create  and use a customer managed KMS key.  Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in request parameters except SecretBinary or SecretString because it might be logged. For more information, see Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail.  Required permissions:  secretsmanager:CreateSecret. If you  include tags in the secret, you also need secretsmanager:TagResource. For more information, see  IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager and Authentication  and access control in Secrets Manager.  To encrypt the secret with a KMS key other than aws/secretsmanager, you need kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permission to the key.

The default recovery window is 30 days. Secrets Manager attaches a DeletionDate stamp to the secret that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently. You can't delete a primary secret that is replicated to other Regions. You must first delete the  replicas using RemoveRegionsFromReplication, and then delete the primary secret.  When you delete a replica, it is deleted immediately. You can't directly delete a version of a secret. Instead, you remove all staging labels  from the version using UpdateSecretVersionStage. This marks the version as deprecated,  and then Secrets Manager can automatically delete the version in the background. To determine whether an application still uses a secret, you can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm  to alert you to any attempts to access a secret during the recovery window. For more information,  see  Monitor secrets scheduled for deletion. Secrets Manager performs the permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period as a background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for the permanent delete to occur. At any time before recovery window ends, you can use RestoreSecret to remove the DeletionDate and cancel the deletion of the secret. When a secret is scheduled for deletion, you cannot retrieve the secret value. You must first cancel the deletion with RestoreSecret and then you can retrieve the secret.

Secrets Manager removes outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it does not  remove versions created less than 24 hours ago.

If you include the configuration parameters, the operation sets the values for the secret and then immediately starts a rotation. If you don't include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a rotation with the values already stored in the secret.  For database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to be able to rotate the secret, you must  make sure the secret value is in the JSON structure of a database secret. In particular, if you want to use the  alternating users strategy, your secret must contain the ARN of a superuser secret.  To configure rotation, you also need the ARN of an Amazon Web Services Lambda function and the schedule  for the rotation. The Lambda rotation function creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the credentials on the database or service to match. After testing the new credentials, the function marks the new secret version with the staging label AWSCURRENT. Then anyone who retrieves the secret gets the new version. For more information, see How rotation works. You can create the Lambda rotation function based on the rotation function templates that Secrets Manager provides. Choose  a template that matches your Rotation strategy. When rotation is successful, the AWSPENDING staging label might be attached to the same version as the AWSCURRENT version, or it might not be attached to any version. If the AWSPENDING staging label is present but not attached to the same version as AWSCURRENT, then any later invocation of RotateSecret assumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error. When rotation is unsuccessful, the AWSPENDING staging label might be attached to an empty secret version. For more information, see Troubleshoot rotation in the Secrets Manager User Guide.

    /// Modifies the staging labels attached to a version of a secret. Secrets Manager uses staging labels to track a version as it progresses through the secret rotation process. Each staging label can be  attached to only one version at a time. To add a staging label to a version when it is already  attached to another version, Secrets Manager first removes it from the other version first and then attaches it to this one. For more information about versions and staging labels, see Concepts: Version.  The staging labels that you specify in the VersionStage parameter are added to the existing list of staging labels for the version.  You can move the AWSCURRENT staging label to this version by including it in this call.  Whenever you move AWSCURRENT, Secrets Manager automatically moves the label AWSPREVIOUS to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed from.  If this action results in the last label being removed from a version, then the version is considered to be 'deprecated' and can be deleted by Secrets Manager.
