/// Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager provides a service to enable you to store, manage, and retrieve, secrets. This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information about using this service, see the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide.  API Version  This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17. For a list of endpoints, see Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager  endpoints.  Support and Feedback for Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager  We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com, or post your feedback and questions in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Discussion Forum. For more information about the Amazon Web Services Discussion Forums, see Forums Help.  Logging API Requests  Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support for Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see Logging Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide. To learn more about CloudTrail, including enabling it and find your log files, see the Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User Guide.

The secret also  includes the connection information to access a database or other service, which Secrets Manager  doesn't encrypt. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret. For secrets that use managed rotation, you need to create the secret through the managing service. For more information, see Secrets Manager secrets managed by other Amazon Web Services services.
    ///   For information about creating a secret in the console, see Create a secret. To create a secret, you can provide the secret value to be encrypted in either the SecretString parameter or the SecretBinary parameter, but not both.  If you include SecretString or SecretBinary then Secrets Manager creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to it. For database credentials you want to rotate, for Secrets Manager to be able to rotate the secret, you must make sure the JSON you store in the SecretString matches the JSON structure of a database secret. If you don't specify an KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed key  aws/secretsmanager.

Creating aws/secretsmanager can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the  result. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling the API, then  you can't use aws/secretsmanager to encrypt the secret, and you must create  and use a customer managed KMS key.

For more information, see Logging Secrets Manager events with CloudTrail.  Required permissions:  secretsmanager:CreateSecret. If you  include tags in the secret, you also need secretsmanager:TagResource. To add replica Regions, you must also have secretsmanager:ReplicateSecretToRegions. For more information, see  IAM policy actions for Secrets Manager and Authentication  and access control in Secrets Manager.  To encrypt the secret with a KMS key other than aws/secretsmanager, you need kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permission to the key.   When you enter commands in a command shell, there is a risk of the command history being accessed or utilities having access to your command parameters.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - addReplicaRegions: A list of Regions and KMS keys to replicate secrets.
    ///   - clientRequestToken: If you include SecretString or SecretBinary, then  Secrets Manager creates an initial version for the secret, and this parameter specifies the unique identifier for the new version.   If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request.   If you generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken and include it in the request. This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.    If the ClientRequestToken value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.    If a version with this value already exists and the version SecretString and SecretBinary values are the same as those in the request, then the request is ignored.   If a version with this value already exists and that version's SecretString and SecretBinary values are different from those in the request, then the request fails because you cannot modify an existing version. Instead, use PutSecretValue to create a new version.   This value becomes the VersionId of the new version.
    ///   - description: The description of the secret.
    ///   - forceOverwriteReplicaSecret: Specifies whether to overwrite a secret with the same name in the destination Region. By default, secrets aren't overwritten.
    ///   - kmsKeyId: The ARN, key ID, or alias of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses to encrypt the secret value in the secret. An alias is always prefixed by alias/,  for example alias/aws/secretsmanager. For more information, see About aliases. To use a KMS key in a different account, use the key ARN or the alias ARN. If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager uses the key aws/secretsmanager.  If that key doesn't yet exist, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically the first time it  encrypts the secret value. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling the API, then  you can't use aws/secretsmanager to encrypt the secret, and you must create  and use a customer managed KMS key.
    ///   - name: The name of the new secret. The secret name can contain ASCII letters, numbers, and the following characters: /_+=.@- Do not end your secret name with a hyphen followed by six characters. If you do so, you risk confusion and unexpected results when searching for a secret by partial ARN. Secrets Manager automatically adds a hyphen and six random characters after the secret name at the end of the ARN.
    ///   - secretBinary: The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. We recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then pass the contents of the file as a parameter. Either SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both. This parameter is not available in the Secrets Manager console. Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If you create your own log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this field.
    ///   - secretString: The text data to encrypt and store in this new version of the secret. We recommend you use a JSON structure of key/value pairs for your secret value. Either SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both. If you create a secret by using the Secrets Manager console then Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the SecretString parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that a Lambda rotation function can parse. Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If you create your own log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this field.
    ///   - tags: A list of tags to attach to the secret. Each tag is a key and value pair of strings in a JSON text string, for example:  [{"Key":"CostCenter","Value":"12345"},{"Key":"environment","Value":"production"}]  Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key "ABC" is a different tag from one with key "abc". If you check tags in permissions policies as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the completion of this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then Secrets Manager blocks the operation and returns an Access Denied error. For more information, see Control  access to secrets using tags and Limit access to identities with tags that match secrets' tags. For information about how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters. If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. For tag quotas and naming restrictions, see Service quotas for Tagging in the Amazon Web Services General  Reference guide.

    ///   - forceDeleteWithoutRecovery: Specifies whether to delete the secret without any recovery window. You can't use both this parameter and RecoveryWindowInDays in the same call. If you don't use either, then by default Secrets Manager uses a 30 day recovery window. Secrets Manager performs the actual deletion with an asynchronous background process, so there might  be a short delay before the secret is permanently deleted. If you delete a secret and then  immediately create a secret with the same name, use appropriate back off and retry logic. If you forcibly delete an already deleted or nonexistent secret, the operation does not return ResourceNotFoundException.  Use this parameter with caution. This parameter causes the operation to skip the normal recovery window before the permanent deletion that Secrets Manager would normally impose with the RecoveryWindowInDays parameter. If you delete a secret with the ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery parameter, then you have no opportunity to recover the secret. You lose the secret permanently.

If a version with this value already exists and the version of the SecretString and SecretBinary values are different from those in the request, then the request fails because you can't modify a secret  version. You can only create new versions to store new secret values.   This value becomes the VersionId of the new version.
    ///   - rotationToken: A unique identifier that indicates the source of the request.

For more information, see How rotation works. Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If you create your own log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this field.
    ///   - secretBinary: The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then pass the contents of the file as a parameter.  You must include SecretBinary or SecretString, but not both. You can't access this value from the Secrets Manager console. Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If you create your own log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this field.
    ///   - secretId: The ARN or name of the secret to add a new version to. For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather  than a partial ARN. See Finding a secret from a partial ARN. If the secret doesn't already exist, use CreateSecret instead.
    ///   - secretString: The text to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.  You must include SecretBinary or SecretString, but not both.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - clientRequestToken: If you include SecretString or SecretBinary, then Secrets Manager creates  a new version for the secret, and this parameter specifies the unique identifier for the new  version.  If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request.   If you generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken and include it in the request. This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.
    ///   - description: The description of the secret.
    ///   - kmsKeyId: The ARN, key ID, or alias of the KMS key that Secrets Manager  uses to encrypt new secret versions as well as any existing versions with the staging labels  AWSCURRENT, AWSPENDING, or AWSPREVIOUS. If you don't have kms:Encrypt permission to the new key, Secrets Manager does not re-encrypt existing secret versions with the new key. For more information about versions and staging labels, see Concepts: Version. A key alias is always prefixed by alias/, for example alias/aws/secretsmanager. For more information, see About aliases. If you set this to an empty string, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed key  aws/secretsmanager. If this key doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets Manager  creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account automatically have access  to use aws/secretsmanager. Creating aws/secretsmanager can result in a one-time  significant delay in returning the result.    You can only use the Amazon Web Services managed key aws/secretsmanager if you call this operation using credentials from the same Amazon Web Services account that owns the secret. If the secret is in a different account, then you must use a customer managed key and provide the ARN of that KMS key in this field. The user making the call must have permissions to both the secret and the KMS key in their respective accounts.
    ///   - secretBinary: The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret. We recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then pass the contents of the file as a parameter.  Either SecretBinary or SecretString must have a value, but not both. You can't access this parameter in the Secrets Manager console. Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service does not include it in CloudTrail log entries.
