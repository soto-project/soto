If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request.   If you generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken and include it in the request. This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.    If the ClientRequestToken value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.    If a version with this value already exists and the version SecretString and SecretBinary values are the same as those in the request, then the request is ignored.   If a version with this value already exists and that version's SecretString and SecretBinary values are different from those in the request, then the request fails because you cannot modify an existing version. Instead, use PutSecretValue to create a new version.   This value becomes the VersionId of the new version.

For more information, see About aliases. To use a KMS key in a different account, use the key ARN or the alias ARN. If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager uses the key aws/secretsmanager.  If that key doesn't yet exist, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically the first time it  encrypts the secret value. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling the API, then  you can't use aws/secretsmanager to encrypt the secret, and you must create  and use a customer managed KMS key.

Either SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both. This parameter is not available in the Secrets Manager console. Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service does not include it in CloudTrail log entries.

Either SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both. If you create a secret by using the Secrets Manager console then Secrets Manager puts the protected secret text in only the SecretString parameter. The Secrets Manager console stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs that a Lambda rotation function can parse. Sensitive: This field contains sensitive information, so the service does not include it in CloudTrail log entries. If you create your own log entries, you must also avoid logging the information in this field.

Each tag is a key and value pair of strings in a JSON text string, for example:  [{"Key":"CostCenter","Value":"12345"},{"Key":"environment","Value":"production"}]  Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key "ABC" is a different tag from one with key "abc". If you check tags in permissions policies as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the completion of this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then Secrets Manager blocks the operation and returns an Access Denied error. For more information, see Control  access to secrets using tags and Limit access to identities with tags that match secrets' tags. For information about how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters. If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text. For tag quotas and naming restrictions, see Service quotas for Tagging in the Amazon Web Services General  Reference guide.
