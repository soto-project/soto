/// Service object for interacting with AWS SecretsManager service.

/// Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager provides a service to enable you to store, manage, and retrieve, secrets. This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information about using this service, see the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide.  API Version  This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17.  As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs provide cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including downloading and installing them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  We recommend you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Secrets Manager. However, you also can use the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To learn more about the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API, see Making Query Requests in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide.  Secrets Manager API supports GET and POST requests for all actions, and doesn't require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request.  Support and Feedback for Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager  We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com, or post your feedback and questions in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Discussion Forum. For more information about the Amazon Web Services Discussion Forums, see Forums Help.  How examples are presented  The JSON that Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters and the service returns as a response to HTTP query requests contain single, long strings without line breaks or white space formatting. The JSON shown in the examples displays the code formatted with both line breaks and white space to improve readability. When example input parameters can also cause long strings extending beyond the screen, you can insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON text string.  Logging API Requests  Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support for Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see Logging Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide. To learn more about CloudTrail, including enabling it and find your log files, see the Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User Guide.

    /// Turns off automatic rotation, and if a rotation is currently in progress, cancels the rotation. To turn on automatic rotation again, call RotateSecret.  If you cancel a rotation in progress, it can leave the VersionStage labels in an unexpected state. Depending on the step of the rotation in progress, you might need to remove the staging label AWSPENDING from the partially created version, specified by the VersionId response value. We recommend you also evaluate the partially rotated new version to see if it should be deleted. You can delete a version by removing all staging labels from it.

The secret also includes the connection information to access a database or other service, which Secrets Manager doesn't encrypt. A secret in Secrets Manager consists of both the protected secret data and the important information needed to manage the secret. For information about creating a secret in the console, see Create a secret. To create a secret, you can provide the secret value to be encrypted in either the SecretString parameter or the SecretBinary parameter, but not both. If you include SecretString or SecretBinary then Secrets Manager creates an initial secret version and automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to it. If you don't specify an KMS encryption key, Secrets Manager uses the Amazon Web Services managed key aws/secretsmanager. If this key doesn't already exist in your account, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically. All users and roles in the Amazon Web Services account automatically have access to use aws/secretsmanager. Creating aws/secretsmanager can result in a one-time significant delay in returning the result. If the secret is in a different Amazon Web Services account from the credentials calling the API, then you can't use aws/secretsmanager to encrypt the secret, and you must create and use a customer managed KMS key.

At the end of the recovery window, Secrets Manager deletes the secret permanently. For information about deleting a secret in the console, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/manage_delete-secret.html.  Secrets Manager performs the permanent secret deletion at the end of the waiting period as a background task with low priority. There is no guarantee of a specific time after the recovery window for the permanent delete to occur. At any time before recovery window ends, you can use RestoreSecret to remove the DeletionDate and cancel the deletion of the secret. In a secret scheduled for deletion, you cannot access the encrypted secret value. To access that information, first cancel the deletion with RestoreSecret and then retrieve the information.

    /// Creates a new version with a new encrypted secret value and attaches it to the secret. The version can contain a new SecretString value or a new SecretBinary value.  We recommend you avoid calling PutSecretValue at a sustained rate of more than once every 10 minutes. When you update the secret value, Secrets Manager creates a new version of the secret. Secrets Manager removes outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it does not remove versions created less than 24 hours ago. If you call PutSecretValue more than once every 10 minutes, you create more versions than Secrets Manager removes, and you will reach the quota for secret versions. You can specify the staging labels to attach to the new version in VersionStages. If you don't include VersionStages, then Secrets Manager automatically moves the staging label AWSCURRENT to this version. If this operation creates the first version for the secret, then Secrets Manager automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to it . If this operation moves the staging label AWSCURRENT from another version to this version, then Secrets Manager also automatically moves the staging label AWSPREVIOUS to the version that AWSCURRENT was removed from. This operation is idempotent. If a version with a VersionId with the same value as the ClientRequestToken parameter already exists, and you specify the same secret data, the operation succeeds but does nothing. However, if the secret data is different, then the operation fails because you can't modify an existing version; you can only create new ones.

If you include the configuration parameters, the operation sets the values for the secret and then immediately starts a rotation. If you don't include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a rotation with the values already stored in the secret. For more information about rotation, see Rotate secrets. To configure rotation, you include the ARN of an Amazon Web Services Lambda function and the schedule for the rotation. The Lambda rotation function creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the credentials on the database or service to match. After testing the new credentials, the function marks the new secret version with the staging label AWSCURRENT. Then anyone who retrieves the secret gets the new version. For more information, see How rotation works. When rotation is successful, the AWSPENDING staging label might be attached to the same version as the AWSCURRENT version, or it might not be attached to any version. If the AWSPENDING staging label is present but not attached to the same version as AWSCURRENT, then any later invocation of RotateSecret assumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns an error. To run this command, you must have secretsmanager:RotateSecret permissions and lambda:InvokeFunction permissions on the function specified in the secret's metadata.

Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or values because Amazon Web Services reserves it for Amazon Web Services use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret limit.   If you use your tagging schema across multiple services and resources, other services might have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters: letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.    If you use tags as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If successfully completing this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then the operation is blocked and returns an Access Denied error.
