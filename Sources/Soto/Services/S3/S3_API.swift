    /// This action aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.  To verify that all parts have been removed, so you don't get charged for the part storage, you should call the ListParts action and ensure that the parts list is empty. For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload, see Multipart Upload and Permissions. The following operations are related to AbortMultipartUpload:    CreateMultipartUpload     UploadPart     CompleteMultipartUpload     ListParts     ListMultipartUploads

    /// Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts. You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the UploadPart operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this action to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the Complete Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list. You must ensure that the parts list is complete. This action concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the ETag value, returned after that part was uploaded. Processing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that you check the response body to determine whether the request succeeded. Note that if CompleteMultipartUpload fails, applications should be prepared to retry the failed requests. For more information, see Amazon S3 Error Best Practices. For more information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload. For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions.  CompleteMultipartUpload has the following special errors:   Error code: EntityTooSmall    Description: Your proposed upload is smaller than the minimum allowed object size. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part.   400 Bad Request     Error code: InvalidPart    Description: One or more of the specified parts could not be found. The part might not have been uploaded, or the specified entity tag might not have matched the part's entity tag.   400 Bad Request     Error code: InvalidPartOrder    Description: The list of parts was not in ascending order. The parts list must be specified in order by part number.   400 Bad Request     Error code: NoSuchUpload    Description: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.   404 Not Found     The following operations are related to CompleteMultipartUpload:    CreateMultipartUpload     UploadPart     AbortMultipartUpload     ListParts     ListMultipartUploads

    /// Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.  You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information, see Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API.  All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have read access to the source object and write access to the destination bucket. For more information, see REST Authentication. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account. A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the 200 OK response. This means that a 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.  If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.  The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see Amazon S3 pricing.  Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 Bad Request error. For more information, see Transfer Acceleration.   Metadata  When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see Using ACLs.  To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the x-amz-metadata-directive header. When you grant permissions, you can use the s3:x-amz-metadata-directive condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see Specifying Conditions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition keys, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3.   x-amz-copy-source-if Headers  To only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the Etag matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the following request parameters:    x-amz-copy-source-if-match     x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match     x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since     x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since     If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:    x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true    x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false   If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the 412 Precondition Failed response code:    x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false    x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true    All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source, must be signed.   Server-side encryption  When you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the object using server-side encryption with AWS managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided encryption key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see Using Server-Side Encryption. If a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Keys in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers  When copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API.   Storage Class Options  You can use the CopyObject action to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the StorageClass parameter. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Versioning  By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the versionId subresource. If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the x-amz-version-id response header in the response. If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null. If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see RestoreObject. The following operations are related to CopyObject:    PutObject     GetObject    For more information, see Copying Objects.
    /// http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectCOPY.html
    public func copyObject(_ input: CopyObjectRequest, logger: Logger = AWSClient.loggingDisabled, on eventLoop: EventLoop? = nil) -> EventLoopFuture<CopyObjectOutput> {

    }

    /// Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid AWS Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner. Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Bucket naming rules. If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see Create Bucket.  By default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see Accessing a bucket.  If you send your create bucket request to the s3.amazonaws.com endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see Virtual hosting of buckets.  When creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket. There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.   Specify a canned ACL using the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly using the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-write, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access control list (ACL) overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account    uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (São Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the AWS accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:  x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"      You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  The following operations are related to CreateBucket:    PutObject     DeleteBucket
    /// http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTBucketPUT.html
    public func createBucket(_ input: CreateBucketRequest, logger: Logger = AWSClient.loggingDisabled, on eventLoop: EventLoop? = nil) -> EventLoopFuture<CreateBucketOutput> {
        return self.client.execute(operation: "CreateBucket", path: "/{Bucket}", httpMethod: .PUT, serviceConfig: self.config, input: input, logger: logger, on: eventLoop)
    }

    /// This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see UploadPart). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request. For more information about multipart uploads, see Multipart Upload Overview. If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy. For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions. For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4).   After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.   You can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMKs) or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in UploadPart and UploadPartCopy requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using CreateMultipartUpload.  To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an AWS KMS CMK, the requester must have permission to the kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey* actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see Multipart upload API and permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same AWS account as the AWS KMS CMK, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.  For more information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption.  Access Permissions  When copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:   Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview.   You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  Server-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers  You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use AWS managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key.    Use encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) – If you want AWS to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.   x-amz-server-side-encryption   x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id   x-amz-server-side-encryption-context    If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms, but don't provide x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the AWS managed CMK in AWS KMS to protect the data.   All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by AWS KMS fail if you don't make them with SSL or by using SigV4.  For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS.   Use customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5   For more information about server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS), see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS.    Access-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers  You also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see Using ACLs. With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:   Specify a canned ACL (x-amz-acl) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific AWS accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:   x-amz-grant-read   x-amz-grant-write   x-amz-grant-read-acp   x-amz-grant-write-acp   x-amz-grant-full-control   You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account    uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (São Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the AWS accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:  x-amz-grant-read: id="11112222333", id="444455556666"       The following operations are related to CreateMultipartUpload:    UploadPart     CompleteMultipartUpload     AbortMultipartUpload     ListParts     ListMultipartUploads

If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead. The request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.  The action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any information about the delete in the response body. When performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see  MFA Delete.

    /// Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use GET, you must have READ access to the object. If you grant READ access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization header. An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object sample.jpg, you can name it photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the GET operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg, specify the resource as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For a path-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket, specify the resource as /examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For more information about request types, see HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification. To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs by using BitTorrent. For more information, see Amazon S3 Torrent. For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see GetObjectAcl. If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using RestoreObject. Otherwise, this action returns an InvalidObjectStateError error. For information about restoring archived objects, see Restoring Archived Objects. Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error. If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5   For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys). Assuming you have permission to read object tags (permission for the s3:GetObjectVersionTagging action), the response also returns the x-amz-tagging-count header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the object. You can use GetObjectTagging to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.  Permissions  You need the s3:GetObject permission for this operation. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.   If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error.   If you don’t have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error.    Versioning  By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the versionId subresource.  If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes x-amz-delete-marker: true in the response.  For more information about versioning, see PutBucketVersioning.   Overriding Response Header Values  There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response. For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET request. You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are Content-Type, Content-Language, Expires, Cache-Control, Content-Disposition, and Content-Encoding. To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.  You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.     response-content-type     response-content-language     response-expires     response-cache-control     response-content-disposition     response-content-encoding     Additional Considerations about Request Headers  If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: If-Match condition evaluates to true, and; If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.  If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: If-None-Match condition evaluates to false, and; If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.

To list the additional multipart uploads, use the key-marker and upload-id-marker request parameters. In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has initiated more than one multipart upload using the same object key, then uploads in the response are first sorted by key. Additionally, uploads are sorted in ascending order within each key by the upload initiation time. For more information on multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload.

    /// Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL). For more information, see Using ACLs. To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have WRITE_ACP permission. You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:   Specify the ACL in the request body   Specify permissions using request headers    You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.  Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.  Access Permissions  You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:   Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account    uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (São Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-write header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.  x-amz-grant-write: uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery", id="111122223333", id="555566667777"     You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  Grantee Values  You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:   By the person's ID:  &lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"&gt;&lt;ID&gt;&lt;&gt;ID&lt;&gt;&lt;/ID&gt;&lt;DisplayName&gt;&lt;&gt;GranteesEmail&lt;&gt;&lt;/DisplayName&gt; &lt;/Grantee&gt;  DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request   By URI:  &lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"&gt;&lt;URI&gt;&lt;&gt;http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers&lt;&gt;&lt;/URI&gt;&lt;/Grantee&gt;    By Email address:  &lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"&gt;&lt;EmailAddress&gt;&lt;&gt;Grantees@email.com&lt;&gt;&lt;/EmailAddress&gt;lt;/Grantee&gt;  The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.

By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others. You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is http://www.example.com to access your Amazon S3 bucket at my.example.bucket.com by using the browser's XMLHttpRequest capability. To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the cors subresource to the bucket. The cors subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size.  When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the cors configuration on the bucket and uses the first CORSRule rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:   The request's Origin header must match AllowedOrigin elements.   The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the Access-Control-Request-Method header in case of a pre-flight OPTIONS request must be one of the AllowedMethod elements.    Every header specified in the Access-Control-Request-Headers request header of a pre-flight request must match an AllowedHeader element.

    /// Enables notifications of specified events for a bucket. For more information about event notifications, see Configuring Event Notifications. Using this API, you can replace an existing notification configuration. The configuration is an XML file that defines the event types that you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destination where you want Amazon S3 to publish an event notification when it detects an event of the specified type. By default, your bucket has no event notifications configured. That is, the notification configuration will be an empty NotificationConfiguration.  &lt;NotificationConfiguration&gt;   &lt;/NotificationConfiguration&gt;  This action replaces the existing notification configuration with the configuration you include in the request body. After Amazon S3 receives this request, it first verifies that any Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) or Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) destination exists, and that the bucket owner has permission to publish to it by sending a test notification. In the case of AWS Lambda destinations, Amazon S3 verifies that the Lambda function permissions grant Amazon S3 permission to invoke the function from the Amazon S3 bucket. For more information, see Configuring Notifications for Amazon S3 Events. You can disable notifications by adding the empty NotificationConfiguration element. By default, only the bucket owner can configure notifications on a bucket. However, bucket owners can use a bucket policy to grant permission to other users to set this configuration with s3:PutBucketNotification permission.  The PUT notification is an atomic operation. For example, suppose your notification configuration includes SNS topic, SQS queue, and Lambda function configurations. When you send a PUT request with this configuration, Amazon S3 sends test messages to your SNS topic. If the message fails, the entire PUT action will fail, and Amazon S3 will not add the configuration to your bucket.   Responses  If the configuration in the request body includes only one TopicConfiguration specifying only the s3:ReducedRedundancyLostObject event type, the response will also include the x-amz-sns-test-message-id header containing the message ID of the test notification sent to the topic.

In the replication configuration, you provide the name of the destination bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects, the IAM role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf, and other relevant information. A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset. To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: DeleteMarkerReplication, Status, and Priority.  If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see Backward Compatibility.  For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see Using Versioning. By default, a resource owner, in this case the AWS account that created the bucket, can perform this operation. The resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform the operation.

Suspended—Disables versioning for the objects in the bucket. All objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null. If the versioning state has never been set on a bucket, it has no versioning state; a GetBucketVersioning request does not return a versioning state value. If the bucket owner enables MFA Delete in the bucket versioning configuration, the bucket owner must include the x-amz-mfa request header and the Status and the MfaDelete request elements in a request to set the versioning state of the bucket.  If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned bucket and you want to maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a noncurrent expiration policy.

    /// Adds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it. Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket. Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead. To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the Content-MD5 header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.   The Content-MD5 header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Server-side Encryption  You can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use AWS managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information, see Using Server-Side Encryption. If you request server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Keys in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers  You can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API.   Storage Class Options  By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Versioning  If you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects. For more information about versioning, see Adding Objects to Versioning Enabled Buckets. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see GetBucketVersioning.

For more information, see What permissions can I grant? in the Amazon S3 User Guide. This action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts. Depending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access Permissions  You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:   Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account    uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (São Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants list objects permission to the two AWS accounts identified by their email addresses.  x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"     You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  Grantee Values  You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:   By the person's ID:  &lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="CanonicalUser"&gt;&lt;ID&gt;&lt;&gt;ID&lt;&gt;&lt;/ID&gt;&lt;DisplayName&gt;&lt;&gt;GranteesEmail&lt;&gt;&lt;/DisplayName&gt; &lt;/Grantee&gt;  DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.   By URI:  &lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="Group"&gt;&lt;URI&gt;&lt;&gt;http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers&lt;&gt;&lt;/URI&gt;&lt;/Grantee&gt;    By Email address:  &lt;Grantee xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:type="AmazonCustomerByEmail"&gt;&lt;EmailAddress&gt;&lt;&gt;Grantees@email.com&lt;&gt;&lt;/EmailAddress&gt;lt;/Grantee&gt;  The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)    US West (Oregon)    Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (São Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the AWS General Reference.

You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an overview about select requests, see Querying Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide. When making a select request, do the following:   Define an output location for the select query's output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried. The AWS account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see Querying Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the S3 structure in the request body, see the following:    PutObject     Managing Access with ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide     Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide      Define the SQL expression for the SELECT type of restoration for your query in the request body's SelectParameters structure. You can use expressions like the following examples.   The following expression returns all records from the specified object.  SELECT * FROM Object    Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers.  SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 &gt; 100    If you have headers and you set the fileHeaderInfo in the CSV structure in the request body to USE, you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the fileHeaderInfo field to IGNORE, the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names.   SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s      For more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore, see SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  When making a select request, you can also do the following:   To expedite your queries, specify the Expedited tier. For more information about tiers, see "Restoring Archives," later in this topic.   Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.   The following are additional important facts about the select feature:   The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.   You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.    Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response 409.    Restoring objects  Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real time. For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify. To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version. When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the Tier element of the request body:      Expedited  - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.     Standard  - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.     Bulk  - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.   For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for Expedited data access, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see  Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  To get the status of object restoration, you can send a HEAD request. Operations return the x-amz-restore header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications in the Amazon S3 User Guide. After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object. If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration and Object Lifecycle Management in Amazon S3 User Guide.  Responses  A successful action returns either the 200 OK or 202 Accepted status code.    If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns 202 Accepted in the response.    If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK in the response.     Special Errors       Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress     Cause: Object restore is already in progress.

    /// Uploads a part in a multipart upload.  In this operation, you provide part data in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the UploadPartCopy operation.   You must initiate a multipart upload (see CreateMultipartUpload) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request. Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload. To ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.  If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then AWS S3 uses the x-amz-content-sha256 header as a checksum instead of Content-MD5. For more information see Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (AWS Signature Version 4).   Note: After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage. For more information on multipart uploads, go to Multipart Upload Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide . For information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide. You can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of providing your own encryption key, or you can use the AWS managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using CreateMultipartUpload. For more information, go to Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see CreateMultipartUpload. If you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following headers.   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5    Special Errors       Code: NoSuchUpload     Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist.

    /// Uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as data source. You specify the data source by adding the request header x-amz-copy-source in your request and a byte range by adding the request header x-amz-copy-source-range in your request.  The minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. For more information about multipart upload limits, go to Quick Facts in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Instead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the UploadPart action and provide data in your request.  You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique identifier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part request. For more information about using the UploadPartCopy operation, see the following:   For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   For information about copying objects using a single atomic action vs. the multipart upload, see Operations on Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys with the UploadPartCopy operation, see CopyObject and UploadPart.   Note the following additional considerations about the request headers x-amz-copy-source-if-match, x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match, x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since, and x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since:      Consideration 1 - If both of the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since headers are present in the request as follows:  x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true, and;  x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false; Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data.     Consideration 2 - If both of the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since headers are present in the request as follows:  x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false, and;  x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true; Amazon S3 returns 412 Precondition Failed response code.     Versioning  If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the current version of the object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the x-amz-copy-source, Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the x-amz-copy-source and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the x-amz-copy-source.  You can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to copy by adding the versionId subresource as shown in the following example:  x-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id   Special Errors       Code: NoSuchUpload     Cause: The specified multipart upload does not exist.

    /// Passes transformed objects to a GetObject operation when using Object Lambda Access Points. For information about Object Lambda Access Points, see Transforming objects with Object Lambda Access Points in the Amazon S3 User Guide. This operation supports metadata that can be returned by GetObject, in addition to RequestRoute, RequestToken, StatusCode, ErrorCode, and ErrorMessage. The GetObject response metadata is supported so that the WriteGetObjectResponse caller, typically an AWS Lambda function, can provide the same metadata when it internally invokes GetObject. When WriteGetObjectResponse is called by a customer-owned Lambda function, the metadata returned to the end user GetObject call might differ from what Amazon S3 would normally return. AWS provides some prebuilt Lambda functions that you can use with S3 Object Lambda to detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) and decompress S3 objects. These Lambda functions are available in the AWS Serverless Application Repository, and can be selected through the AWS Management Console when you create your Object Lambda Access Point. Example 1: PII Access Control - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically detects personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.  Example 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.  Example 3: Decompression - The Lambda function S3ObjectLambdaDecompression, is equipped to decompress objects stored in S3 in one of six compressed file formats including bzip2, gzip, snappy, zlib, zstandard and ZIP.  For information on how to view and use these functions, see Using AWS built Lambda functions in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

    // MARK: Streaming API Calls

    /// Retrieves objects from Amazon S3. To use GET, you must have READ access to the object. If you grant READ access to the anonymous user, you can return the object without using an authorization header. An Amazon S3 bucket has no directory hierarchy such as you would find in a typical computer file system. You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object sample.jpg, you can name it photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the GET operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg, specify the resource as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For a path-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket, specify the resource as /examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For more information about request types, see HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification. To distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs by using BitTorrent. For more information, see Amazon S3 Torrent. For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see GetObjectAcl. If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using RestoreObject. Otherwise, this action returns an InvalidObjectStateError error. For information about restoring archived objects, see Restoring Archived Objects. Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with CMKs stored in AWS KMS (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error. If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5   For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys). Assuming you have permission to read object tags (permission for the s3:GetObjectVersionTagging action), the response also returns the x-amz-tagging-count header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the object. You can use GetObjectTagging to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.  Permissions  You need the s3:GetObject permission for this operation. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy. If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.   If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 ("no such key") error.   If you don’t have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 403 ("access denied") error.    Versioning  By default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the versionId subresource.  If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes x-amz-delete-marker: true in the response.  For more information about versioning, see PutBucketVersioning.   Overriding Response Header Values  There are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response. For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET request. You can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are Content-Type, Content-Language, Expires, Cache-Control, Content-Disposition, and Content-Encoding. To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.  You must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.     response-content-type     response-content-language     response-expires     response-cache-control     response-content-disposition     response-content-encoding     Additional Considerations about Request Headers  If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: If-Match condition evaluates to true, and; If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.  If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: If-None-Match condition evaluates to false, and; If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.
