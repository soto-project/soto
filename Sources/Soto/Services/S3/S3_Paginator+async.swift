    ///  This action lists in-progress multipart uploads. An in-progress multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated using the Initiate Multipart Upload request, but has not yet been completed or aborted. This action returns at most 1,000 multipart uploads in the response. 1,000 multipart uploads is the maximum number of uploads a response can include, which is also the default value. You can further limit the number of uploads in a response by specifying the max-uploads parameter in the response. If additional multipart uploads satisfy the list criteria, the response will contain an IsTruncated element with the value true. To list the additional multipart uploads, use the key-marker and upload-id-marker request parameters. In the response, the uploads are sorted by key. If your application has initiated more than one multipart upload using the same object key, then uploads in the response are first sorted by key. Additionally, uploads are sorted in ascending order within each key by the upload initiation time. For more information on multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload. For information on permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions. The following operations are related to ListMultipartUploads:    CreateMultipartUpload     UploadPart     CompleteMultipartUpload     ListParts     AbortMultipartUpload

A 200 OK response can contain valid or invalid XML. Make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. Objects are returned sorted in an ascending order of the respective key names in the list. For more information about listing objects, see Listing object keys programmatically  To use this operation, you must have READ access to the bucket. To use this action in an Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, you must have permissions to perform the s3:ListBucket action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources.  This section describes the latest revision of this action. We recommend that you use this revised API for application development. For backward compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the prior version of this API, ListObjects.  To get a list of your buckets, see ListBuckets.

    ///  Lists the parts that have been uploaded for a specific multipart upload. This operation must include the upload ID, which you obtain by sending the initiate multipart upload request (see CreateMultipartUpload). This request returns a maximum of 1,000 uploaded parts. The default number of parts returned is 1,000 parts. You can restrict the number of parts returned by specifying the max-parts request parameter. If your multipart upload consists of more than 1,000 parts, the response returns an IsTruncated field with the value of true, and a NextPartNumberMarker element. In subsequent ListParts requests you can include the part-number-marker query string parameter and set its value to the NextPartNumberMarker field value from the previous response.
