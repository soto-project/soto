    // MARK: API Calls

    /// This operation aborts a multipart upload. After a multipart upload is aborted, no additional parts can be uploaded using that upload ID. The storage consumed by any previously uploaded parts will be freed. However, if any part uploads are currently in progress, those part uploads might or might not succeed. As a result, it might be necessary to abort a given multipart upload multiple times in order to completely free all storage consumed by all parts.  To verify that all parts have been removed and prevent getting charged for the part storage, you should call the ListParts API operation and ensure that the parts list is empty.     Directory buckets -  If multipart uploads in a directory bucket are in progress, you can't delete the bucket until all the in-progress multipart uploads are aborted or completed.  To delete these in-progress multipart uploads, use the ListMultipartUploads operation to list the in-progress multipart uploads in the bucket and use the AbortMultipartUpload operation to abort all the in-progress multipart uploads.     Directory buckets -  For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload, see Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use.
    /// Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires.

Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format  Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported.  Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Availability Zone. Bucket names must follow the format  bucket_base_name--az-id--x-s3 (for example,  DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access points - When you use this action with an access point, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.   S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form  AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

    /// Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts. You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the UploadPart operation or the UploadPartCopy operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this CompleteMultipartUpload operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the CompleteMultipartUpload  request, you must provide the parts list and ensure that the parts list is complete. The CompleteMultipartUpload API operation concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the PartNumber value and the ETag value that are returned after that part was uploaded. The processing of a CompleteMultipartUpload request could take several minutes to finalize. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. A request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent. This means that a 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. The error response might be embedded in the 200 OK response.  If you call this API operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return an error).  Note that if CompleteMultipartUpload fails, applications should be prepared to retry any failed requests (including 500 error responses). For more information, see Amazon S3 Error Best Practices.  You can't use Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded for the  CompleteMultipartUpload requests. Also, if you don't provide a Content-Type header, CompleteMultipartUpload can still return a 200 OK response.  For more information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Directory buckets -  For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If you provide an additional checksum value in your MultipartUpload requests and the object is encrypted with Key Management Service, you must have permission to use the kms:Decrypt action for the CompleteMultipartUpload request to succeed.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization.

    /// Completes a multipart upload by assembling previously uploaded parts. You first initiate the multipart upload and then upload all parts using the UploadPart operation or the UploadPartCopy operation. After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this CompleteMultipartUpload operation to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the CompleteMultipartUpload  request, you must provide the parts list and ensure that the parts list is complete. The CompleteMultipartUpload API operation concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the PartNumber value and the ETag value that are returned after that part was uploaded. The processing of a CompleteMultipartUpload request could take several minutes to finalize. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. A request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent. This means that a 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. The error response might be embedded in the 200 OK response.  If you call this API operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return an error).  Note that if CompleteMultipartUpload fails, applications should be prepared to retry any failed requests (including 500 error responses). For more information, see Amazon S3 Error Best Practices.  You can't use Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded for the  CompleteMultipartUpload requests. Also, if you don't provide a Content-Type header, CompleteMultipartUpload can still return a 200 OK response.  For more information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Directory buckets -  For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - For information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If you provide an additional checksum value in your MultipartUpload requests and the object is encrypted with Key Management Service, you must have permission to use the kms:Decrypt action for the CompleteMultipartUpload request to succeed.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use.

    /// Creates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.  You can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy (UploadPartCopy) API. For more information, see Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API.  You can copy individual objects between general purpose buckets, between directory buckets, and  between general purpose buckets and directory buckets.    Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Multi-Region Access Points only as a destination when using the Multi-Region Access Point ARN.     Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   VPC endpoints don't support cross-Region requests (including copies). If you're using VPC endpoints, your source and destination buckets should be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as your VPC endpoint.    Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account. For more information about how to enable a Region for your account, see Enable  or disable a Region for standalone accounts in the Amazon Web Services Account Management Guide.  Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 Bad Request error. For more information, see Transfer Acceleration.   Authentication and authorization  All CopyObject requests must be authenticated and signed by using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source, must be signed. For more information, see REST Authentication.  Directory buckets - You must use the IAM credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the CopyObject API operation, instead of using the  temporary security credentials through the CreateSession API operation. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf.  Permissions  You must have read access to the source object and write access to the destination bucket.    General purpose bucket permissions - You must have permissions in an IAM policy based on the source and destination bucket types in a CopyObject operation.   If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have  s3:GetObject  permission to read the source object that is being copied.    If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have  s3:PutObject  permission to write the object copy to the destination bucket.       Directory bucket permissions - You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy based on the source and destination bucket types in a CopyObject operation.   If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory bucket, you must have the  s3express:CreateSession permission in the Action element of a policy to read the object. By default, the session is in the ReadWrite mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the s3express:SessionMode condition key to ReadOnly on the copy source bucket.   If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the  s3express:CreateSession permission in the Action element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The s3express:SessionMode condition key can't be set to ReadOnly on the copy destination bucket.    If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key. For example policies, see Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone and Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Response and special errors  When the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. When the request is not an HTTP 1.1 request, the response would not contain the Content-Length. You always need to read the entire response body to check if the copy succeeds.    If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.   A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. A 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error.   If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error.   If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the 200 OK response. For example, in a cross-region copy, you  may encounter throttling and receive a 200 OK response.  For more information, see Resolve  the Error 200 response when copying objects to Amazon S3.  The 200 OK status code means the copy was accepted, but   it doesn't mean the copy is complete. Another example is  when you disconnect from Amazon S3 before the copy is complete, Amazon S3 might cancel the copy and you may receive a 200 OK response.  You must stay connected to Amazon S3 until the entire response is successfully received and processed. If you call this API operation directly, make sure to design your application to parse the content of the response and handle it appropriately. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle this condition. The SDKs detect the embedded error and apply error handling per your configuration settings (including automatically retrying the request as appropriate). If the condition persists, the SDKs throw an exception (or, for the SDKs that don't use exceptions, they return an  error).      Charge  The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. The request can also result in a data retrieval charge for the source if the source storage class bills for data retrieval. If the copy source is in a different region, the data transfer is billed to the copy source account. For pricing information, see Amazon S3 pricing.

When you copy an object, if the source object has a checksum, that checksum value will be copied to the new object by default. If the CopyObject request does not include this x-amz-checksum-algorithm header, the checksum algorithm will be copied from the source object to the destination object (if it's present on the source object). You can optionally specify a different checksum algorithm to use with the x-amz-checksum-algorithm header. Unrecognized or unsupported values will respond with the HTTP status code 400 Bad Request.  For directory buckets, when you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, CRC32 is the default checksum algorithm that's used for performance.
    ///   - contentDisposition: Specifies presentational information for the object. Indicates whether an object should be displayed in a web browser or downloaded as a file. It allows specifying the desired filename for the downloaded file.
    ///   - contentEncoding: Specifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.  For directory buckets, only the aws-chunked value is supported in this header field.
    ///   - contentLanguage: The language the content is in.
    ///   - contentType: A standard MIME type that describes the format of the object data.
    ///   - copySource: Specifies the source object for the copy operation. The source object  can be up to 5 GB. If the source object is an object that was uploaded by using a multipart upload, the object copy will be a single part object after the source object is copied to the destination bucket. You specify the value of the copy source in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an access point:   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and the key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf from the general purpose bucket  awsexamplebucket, use awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded. To copy the object reports/january.pdf from the directory bucket  awsexamplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3, use awsexamplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format arn:aws:s3:::accesspoint//object/. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through access point my-access-point owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL encoded.    Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services Region.   Access points are not supported by directory buckets.    Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:::outpost//object/. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.     If your source bucket versioning is enabled, the x-amz-copy-source header by default identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the versionId query parameter. Specifically, append ?versionId= to the value (for example, awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893). If you don't specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of the source object. If you enable versioning on the destination bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the copied object. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the x-amz-version-id response header in the response. If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the destination bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates in the x-amz-version-id response header is always null.   Directory buckets - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets.
    ///   - copySourceIfMatch: Copies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag. If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:    x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true    x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false

    ///   - key: The key of the destination object.
    ///   - metadata: A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
    ///   - metadataDirective: Specifies whether the metadata is copied from the source object or replaced with metadata that's provided in the request.  When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (the default) or specify new metadata. If this header isn’t specified, COPY is the default behavior.    General purpose bucket - For general purpose buckets, when you grant permissions, you can use the s3:x-amz-metadata-directive condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see Amazon S3 condition key examples in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   x-amz-website-redirect-location is unique to each object and is not copied when using the x-amz-metadata-directive header. To copy the value, you  must specify x-amz-website-redirect-location in the request header.
    ///   - objectLockLegalHoldStatus: Specifies whether you want to apply a legal hold to the object copy.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
    ///   - objectLockMode: The Object Lock mode that you want to apply to the object copy.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

    ///   - serverSideEncryption: The server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3. Unrecognized or unsupported values won’t write a destination object and will receive a 400 Bad Request response.  Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are copied to an S3 bucket. When copying an object, if you don't specify encryption information in your copy request, the encryption setting of the target object is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a different default encryption configuration, Amazon S3 uses the corresponding encryption key to encrypt the target object copy. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes your data to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  General purpose buckets     For general purpose buckets, there are the following supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), and  server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the target object copy.   When you perform a CopyObject operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the target object, you can specify  appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the target object with an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence.     Directory buckets     For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (aws:kms). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your  CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects  are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads.   To encrypt new object copies to a directory bucket with SSE-KMS, we recommend you specify SSE-KMS as the directory bucket's default encryption configuration with a KMS key (specifically, a customer managed key).  The Amazon Web Services managed key (aws/s3) isn't supported. Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 customer managed key per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket. After you specify a customer managed key for SSE-KMS, you can't override the customer managed key for the bucket's SSE-KMS configuration.  Then, when you perform a CopyObject operation and want to specify server-side encryption settings for new object copies with SSE-KMS in the encryption-related request headers, you must ensure the encryption key is the same customer managed key that you specified for the directory bucket's default encryption configuration.
    ///   - sseCustomerAlgorithm: Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, AES256). When you perform a CopyObject operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the target object, you can specify  appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the target object with an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key. If the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence.   This functionality is not supported when the destination bucket is a directory bucket.
    ///   - sseCustomerKey: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded. Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.  This functionality is not supported when the destination bucket is a directory bucket.
    ///   - sseCustomerKeyMD5: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.  This functionality is not supported when the destination bucket is a directory bucket.
    ///   - ssekmsEncryptionContext: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context as an additional encryption context to use for the destination object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.  General purpose buckets - This value must be explicitly added to specify encryption context for  CopyObject requests if you want an additional encryption context for your destination object. The additional encryption context of the source object won't be copied to the destination object. For more information, see Encryption context in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Directory buckets - You can optionally provide an explicit encryption context value. The value must match the default encryption context - the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional encryption context value is not supported.
    ///   - ssekmsKeyId: Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by KMS will fail if they're not made via SSL or using SigV4. For information about configuring any of the officially supported Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon Web Services CLI, see Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Directory buckets - If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption with aws:kms, the  x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id header is implicitly assigned the ID of the KMS  symmetric encryption customer managed key that's configured for your directory bucket's default encryption setting.  If you want to specify the  x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id header explicitly, you can only specify it with the ID (Key ID or Key ARN) of the KMS  customer managed key that's configured for your directory bucket's default encryption setting. Otherwise, you get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error. Only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported. Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 customer managed key per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket.
    ///   - storageClass: If the x-amz-storage-class header is not used, the copied object will be stored in the STANDARD Storage Class by default. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class.      Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, only the S3 Express One Zone storage class is supported to store newly created objects.
    ///   - tagging: The tag-set for the object copy in the destination bucket. This value must be used in conjunction with the x-amz-tagging-directive if you choose REPLACE for the x-amz-tagging-directive. If you choose COPY for the x-amz-tagging-directive, you don't need to set  the x-amz-tagging header, because the tag-set will be copied from the source object directly. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query parameters. The default value is the empty value.   Directory buckets - For directory buckets in a CopyObject operation, only the empty tag-set is supported. Any requests that attempt to write non-empty tags into directory buckets will receive a 501 Not Implemented status code.
    ///   - taggingDirective: Specifies whether the object tag-set is copied from the source object or replaced with the tag-set that's provided in the request. The default value is COPY.   Directory buckets - For directory buckets in a CopyObject operation, only the empty tag-set is supported. Any requests that attempt to write non-empty tags into directory buckets will receive a 501 Not Implemented status code.
    ///   - websiteRedirectLocation: If the destination bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object copy to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. This value is unique to each object and is not copied when using the x-amz-metadata-directive header. Instead, you may opt to provide this header in combination with the x-amz-metadata-directive header.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

    ///  This action creates an Amazon S3 bucket. To create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see  CreateBucket .  Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must set up Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner. There are two types of buckets: general purpose buckets and directory buckets. For more information about these bucket types, see Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon S3 buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     General purpose buckets - If you send your CreateBucket request to the s3.amazonaws.com global endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. So the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see Virtual hosting of buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format https://s3express-control.region_code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported.
    /// For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - In addition to the s3:CreateBucket permission, the following permissions are required in a policy when your CreateBucket request includes specific headers:     Access control lists (ACLs) - In your CreateBucket request, if you specify an access control list (ACL)  and set it to public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you explicitly specify any other custom ACLs, both s3:CreateBucket and s3:PutBucketAcl permissions are required. In your CreateBucket request, if you set the ACL to private,  or if you don't specify any ACLs, only the s3:CreateBucket permission is required.     Object Lock - In your CreateBucket request, if you set  x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled to true, the   s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration and s3:PutBucketVersioning permissions are required.    S3 Object Ownership - If your CreateBucket request includes the x-amz-object-ownership header, then the s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls permission is required.  To set an ACL on a bucket as part of a CreateBucket request, you must explicitly set S3 Object Ownership for the bucket to a different value than the default, BucketOwnerEnforced. Additionally, if your desired bucket ACL grants public access, you must first create the bucket (without the bucket ACL) and then explicitly disable Block Public Access on the bucket before using PutBucketAcl to set the ACL. If you try to create a bucket with a public ACL, the request will fail.  For the majority of modern use cases in S3, we recommend that you keep all Block Public Access settings enabled and keep ACLs disabled. If you would like to share data with users outside of your account, you can use bucket policies as needed. For more information, see Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket  and Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage  in the Amazon S3 User Guide.      S3 Block Public Access - If your specific use case requires granting public access to your S3 resources, you can disable Block Public Access. Specifically, you can create a new bucket with Block Public Access enabled, then separately call the  DeletePublicAccessBlock API. To use this operation, you must have the s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock permission. For more information about S3 Block Public Access, see Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage  in the Amazon S3 User Guide.       Directory bucket permissions - You must have the s3express:CreateBucket permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  The permissions for ACLs, Object Lock, S3 Object Ownership, and S3 Block Public Access are not supported for directory buckets.   For directory buckets, all Block Public Access settings are enabled at the bucket level and S3   Object Ownership is set to Bucket owner enforced (ACLs disabled). These settings can't be modified.  For more information about permissions for creating and working with  directory buckets, see Directory buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  For more information about supported S3 features for directory buckets, see Features of S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

To create a bucket, you must set up Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner. There are two types of buckets: general purpose buckets and directory buckets. For more information about these bucket types, see Creating, configuring, and working with Amazon S3 buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     General purpose buckets - If you send your CreateBucket request to the s3.amazonaws.com global endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. So the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see Virtual hosting of buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format https://s3express-control.region_code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported.
    /// For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - In addition to the s3:CreateBucket permission, the following permissions are required in a policy when your CreateBucket request includes specific headers:     Access control lists (ACLs) - In your CreateBucket request, if you specify an access control list (ACL)  and set it to public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you explicitly specify any other custom ACLs, both s3:CreateBucket and s3:PutBucketAcl permissions are required. In your CreateBucket request, if you set the ACL to private,  or if you don't specify any ACLs, only the s3:CreateBucket permission is required.     Object Lock - In your CreateBucket request, if you set  x-amz-bucket-object-lock-enabled to true, the   s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration and s3:PutBucketVersioning permissions are required.    S3 Object Ownership - If your CreateBucket request includes the x-amz-object-ownership header, then the s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls permission is required.  To set an ACL on a bucket as part of a CreateBucket request, you must explicitly set S3 Object Ownership for the bucket to a different value than the default, BucketOwnerEnforced. Additionally, if your desired bucket ACL grants public access, you must first create the bucket (without the bucket ACL) and then explicitly disable Block Public Access on the bucket before using PutBucketAcl to set the ACL. If you try to create a bucket with a public ACL, the request will fail.  For the majority of modern use cases in S3, we recommend that you keep all Block Public Access settings enabled and keep ACLs disabled. If you would like to share data with users outside of your account, you can use bucket policies as needed. For more information, see Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs for your bucket  and Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage  in the Amazon S3 User Guide.      S3 Block Public Access - If your specific use case requires granting public access to your S3 resources, you can disable Block Public Access. Specifically, you can create a new bucket with Block Public Access enabled, then separately call the  DeletePublicAccessBlock API. To use this operation, you must have the s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock permission. For more information about S3 Block Public Access, see Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage  in the Amazon S3 User Guide.       Directory bucket permissions - You must have the s3express:CreateBucket permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  The permissions for ACLs, Object Lock, S3 Object Ownership, and S3 Block Public Access are not supported for directory buckets.   For directory buckets, all Block Public Access settings are enabled at the bucket level and S3   Object Ownership is set to Bucket owner enforced (ACLs disabled). These settings can't be modified.  For more information about permissions for creating and working with  directory buckets, see Directory buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  For more information about supported S3 features for directory buckets, see Features of S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

    /// This action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see UploadPart). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request. For more information about multipart uploads, see Multipart Upload Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  After you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stops charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.   If you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the created multipart   upload must be completed within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Configuration.     Directory buckets  - S3 Lifecycle is not supported by directory buckets.    Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     Request signing  For request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Key Management Service (KMS) KMS key, the requester must have permission to the kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey actions on the key. The requester must also have permissions for the kms:GenerateDataKey action for the CreateMultipartUpload API. Then, the requester needs permissions for the kms:Decrypt action on the UploadPart and UploadPartCopy APIs. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see Multipart upload API and permissions and Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use.
    /// Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession .    Encryption     General purpose buckets - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. Amazon S3 automatically encrypts all new objects that are uploaded to an S3 bucket. When doing a multipart upload, if you don't specify encryption information in your request, the encryption setting of the uploaded parts is set to the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket. By default, all buckets have a base level of encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). If the destination bucket has a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with an Key Management Service (KMS) key (SSE-KMS), or a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), Amazon S3 uses the corresponding KMS key, or a customer-provided key to encrypt the uploaded parts. When you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation, if you want to use a different type of encryption setting for the uploaded parts, you can request that Amazon S3 encrypts the object with a different encryption key (such as an Amazon S3 managed key, a KMS key, or a customer-provided key). When the encryption setting in your request is different from the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket, the encryption setting in your request takes precedence. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in UploadPart and UploadPartCopy requests must match the headers you used in the CreateMultipartUpload request.   Use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) that include the Amazon Web Services managed key (aws/s3) and KMS customer managed keys stored in Key Management Service (KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.    x-amz-server-side-encryption     x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id     x-amz-server-side-encryption-context       If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms, but don't provide x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (aws/s3 key) in KMS to protect the data.   To perform a multipart upload with encryption by using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey* actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see Multipart upload API and permissions and Protecting data using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   If your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role is in a different account from the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.   All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by KMS fail if you don't make them by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), or Signature Version 4. For information about configuring any of the officially supported Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon Web Services CLI, see Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    For more information about server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS), see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Use customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.    x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5    For more information about server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), see  Protecting data using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.      Directory buckets - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (aws:kms). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your  CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects  are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads. In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy) using the REST API, the encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that are specified in the CreateSession request.  You can't override the values of the encryption settings (x-amz-server-side-encryption, x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, x-amz-server-side-encryption-context, and x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled) that are specified in the CreateSession request.  You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and    Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the CreateSession request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.    When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for CreateSession, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the  CreateSession request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values in the CreateSession request.  So in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy),  the encryption request headers must match the default encryption configuration of the directory bucket.

Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (aws:kms). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your  CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects  are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads.           In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy) using the REST API, the encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that are specified in the CreateSession request.  You can't override the values of the encryption settings (x-amz-server-side-encryption, x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, x-amz-server-side-encryption-context, and x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled) that are specified in the CreateSession request.  You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and    Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the CreateSession request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.    When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for CreateSession, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the  CreateSession request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values in the CreateSession request.  So in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy),  the encryption request headers must match the default encryption configuration of the directory bucket.
    ///   - sseCustomerAlgorithm: Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
    ///   - sseCustomerKeyMD5: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the customer-provided encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
    ///   - ssekmsEncryptionContext: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption. The value of this header is a Base64-encoded string of a UTF-8 encoded JSON, which contains the encryption context as key-value pairs.  Directory buckets - You can optionally provide an explicit encryption context value. The value must match the default encryption context - the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional encryption context value is not supported.
    ///   - ssekmsKeyId: Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. If the KMS key doesn't exist in the same account that's issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key ID.  General purpose buckets - If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption with aws:kms or aws:kms:dsse, this header specifies the ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) of the KMS  key to use. If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms or x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms:dsse, but do not provide x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (aws/s3) to protect the data.  Directory buckets - If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption with aws:kms, the  x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id header is implicitly assigned the ID of the KMS  symmetric encryption customer managed key that's configured for your directory bucket's default encryption setting.  If you want to specify the  x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id header explicitly, you can only specify it with the ID (Key ID or Key ARN) of the KMS  customer managed key that's configured for your directory bucket's default encryption setting. Otherwise, you get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error. Only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported. Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 customer managed key per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket.
    ///   - storageClass: By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    For directory buckets, only the S3 Express One Zone storage class is supported to store newly created objects.   Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class.
    ///   - tagging: The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query parameters.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.

For more information about Zonal endpoint API operations that include the Availability Zone in the request endpoint, see  S3 Express One Zone  APIs in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   To make Zonal endpoint API requests on a directory bucket, use the CreateSession API operation. Specifically, you grant s3express:CreateSession permission to a bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you use IAM credentials to make the CreateSession API request on the bucket, which returns temporary security credentials that include the access key ID, secret access key, session token, and expiration. These credentials have associated permissions to access the Zonal endpoint API operations. After the session is created, you don’t need to use other policies to grant permissions to each Zonal endpoint API individually. Instead, in your Zonal endpoint API requests, you sign your requests by applying the temporary security credentials of the session to the request headers and following the SigV4 protocol for authentication. You also apply the session token to the x-amz-s3session-token request header for authorization. Temporary security credentials are scoped to the bucket and expire after 5 minutes. After the expiration time, any calls that you make with those credentials will fail. You must use IAM credentials again to make a CreateSession API request that generates a new set of temporary credentials for use. Temporary credentials cannot be extended or refreshed beyond the original specified interval. If you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, SDKs handle the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to initiate and manage requests to the CreateSession API. For more information, see Performance guidelines and design patterns in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    You must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.     CopyObject API operation - Unlike other Zonal endpoint API operations, the CopyObject API operation doesn't use the temporary security credentials returned from the CreateSession API operation for authentication and authorization. For information about authentication and authorization of the CopyObject API operation on directory buckets, see CopyObject.     HeadBucket API operation - Unlike other Zonal endpoint API operations, the HeadBucket API operation doesn't use the temporary security credentials returned from the CreateSession API operation for authentication and authorization. For information about authentication and authorization of the HeadBucket API operation on directory buckets, see HeadBucket.     Permissions  To obtain temporary security credentials, you must create a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy that grants s3express:CreateSession permission to the bucket. In a policy, you can have the s3express:SessionMode condition key to control who can create a ReadWrite or ReadOnly session. For more information about ReadWrite or ReadOnly sessions, see  x-amz-create-session-mode . For example policies, see Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone and Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  To grant cross-account access to Zonal endpoint API operations, the bucket policy should also grant both accounts the s3express:CreateSession permission.

S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets
    ///   - serverSideEncryption: The server-side encryption algorithm to use when you store objects in the directory bucket. For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (aws:kms). By default, Amazon S3 encrypts data with SSE-S3.  For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
    ///   - sessionMode: Specifies the mode of the session that will be created, either ReadWrite or ReadOnly. By default, a ReadWrite session is created. A ReadWrite session is capable of executing all the Zonal endpoint API operations on a directory bucket. A ReadOnly session is constrained to execute the following Zonal endpoint API operations: GetObject, HeadObject, ListObjectsV2, GetObjectAttributes, ListParts, and ListMultipartUploads.
    ///   - ssekmsEncryptionContext: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context as an additional encryption context to use for object encryption. The value of this header is a Base64-encoded string of a UTF-8 encoded JSON, which contains the encryption context as key-value pairs.  This value is stored as object metadata and automatically gets passed on to Amazon Web Services KMS for future GetObject operations on this object.  General purpose buckets - This value must be explicitly added during CopyObject operations if you want an additional encryption context for your object. For more information, see Encryption context in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Directory buckets - You can optionally provide an explicit encryption context value. The value must match the default encryption context - the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional encryption context value is not supported.
    ///   - ssekmsKeyId: If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption with aws:kms, you must specify the  x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id header with the ID (Key ID or Key ARN) of the KMS  symmetric encryption customer managed key to use. Otherwise, you get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error. Only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported. Also, if the KMS key doesn't exist in the same account that't issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key ID.  Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 customer managed key per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket.

For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    The operation supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the operation uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request.

For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg, specify the object key name as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For a path-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket, specify the object key name as /examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. For more information about request types, see HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Directory buckets - Only virtual-hosted-style requests are supported. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object photos/2006/February/sample.jpg in the bucket named examplebucket--use1-az5--x-s3, specify the object key name as /photos/2006/February/sample.jpg. Also, when you make requests to this API operation, your requests are sent to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - You must have the required permissions in a policy. To use GetObject, you must have the READ access to the object (or version). If you grant READ access to the anonymous user, the GetObject operation  returns the object without using an authorization header. For more information, see Specifying permissions in a policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If you include a versionId in your request header, you must have the s3:GetObjectVersion permission to access a specific version of an object. The s3:GetObject permission is not required in this scenario. If you request the current version of an object without a specific versionId in the request header, only the s3:GetObject permission is required. The s3:GetObjectVersion permission is not required in this scenario.  If the object that you request doesn’t exist, the error that Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.   If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 Not Found error.   If you don’t have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 403 Access Denied error.      Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use.
    /// Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession . If the object is encrypted using  SSE-KMS, you must also have the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.    Storage classes  If the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval storage class, the  S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, the S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive Access tier, or the  S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive Access tier, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using RestoreObject. Otherwise, this operation returns an InvalidObjectState error. For information about restoring archived objects, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, only the S3 Express One Zone storage class is supported to store newly created objects.
    /// Unsupported storage class values won't write a destination object and will respond with the HTTP status code 400 Bad Request.  Encryption  Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for the GetObject requests, if your object uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3), server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS). If you include the header in your GetObject requests for the object that uses  these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error.  Directory buckets - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Overriding response header values through the request  There are times when you want to override certain response header values of a GetObject response. For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value through your GetObject request. You can override values for a set of response headers. These modified response header values are included only in a successful response, that is, when the HTTP status code 200 OK is returned.                    The headers you can override using the following query parameters in the request are a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object.                    The response headers that you can override for the GetObject response are Cache-Control, Content-Disposition,  Content-Encoding, Content-Language, Content-Type, and Expires. To override values for a set of response headers in the GetObject response, you can use the following query parameters in the request.    response-cache-control     response-content-disposition     response-content-encoding     response-content-language     response-content-type     response-expires     When you use these parameters, you must sign the request by using either an Authorization header or a presigned URL. These parameters cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.

For more information, see Mapping of ACL permissions and access policy permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide  This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts. By default, GET returns ACL information about the current version of an object. To return ACL information about a different version, use the versionId subresource.  If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, requests to read ACLs are still supported and return the bucket-owner-full-control ACL with the owner being the account that created the bucket. For more information, see  Controlling object ownership and disabling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

GetObjectAttributes combines the functionality of HeadObject and ListParts. All of the data returned with each of those individual calls can be returned with a single call to GetObjectAttributes.   Directory buckets -  For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - To use GetObjectAttributes, you must have READ access to the object. The permissions that you need to use this operation depend on whether the bucket is versioned. If the bucket is versioned, you need both the s3:GetObjectVersion and s3:GetObjectVersionAttributes permissions for this operation. If the bucket is not versioned, you need the s3:GetObject and s3:GetObjectAttributes permissions. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If the object that you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.   If you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 404 Not Found ("no such key") error.   If you don't have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 403 Forbidden ("access denied") error.      Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use.
    /// Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession . If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.    Encryption   Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for HEAD requests if your object uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The x-amz-server-side-encryption header is used when you PUT an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption method.  If you include this header in a GET request for an object that uses these types of keys,  you’ll get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when you retrieve the object.  If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers to provide the encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the object's metadata. The headers are:     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5    For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Directory bucket permissions - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (aws:kms). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your  CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects  are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads.   Versioning   Directory buckets - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets. For this API operation, only the null value of the version ID is supported by directory buckets. You can only specify null  to the versionId query parameter in the request.  Conditional request headers  Consider the following when using request headers:   If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP status code 200 OK and the data requested:    If-Match condition evaluates to true.    If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false.   For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232.   If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows, then Amazon S3 returns the HTTP status code 304 Not Modified:    If-None-Match condition evaluates to false.    If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true.   For more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232.

Because of this, if the HEAD request generates an error, it returns a generic code, such as 400 Bad Request, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed, 412 Precondition Failed, or 304 Not Modified.  It's not possible to retrieve the exact exception of these error codes.  Request headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see Common Request Headers.

For more information about the permissions to S3 API operations by S3 resource types, see Required permissions for Amazon S3 API operations in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

If you don’t have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP status code 403 Forbidden error.      Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use.

Encryption   Encryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption, should not be sent for HEAD requests if your object uses server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS), dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS), or server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). The x-amz-server-side-encryption header is used when you PUT an object to S3 and want to specify the encryption method.  If you include this header in a HEAD request for an object that uses these types of keys,  you’ll get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error. It's because the encryption method can't be changed when you retrieve the object.  If you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers to provide the encryption key for the server to be able to retrieve the object's metadata. The headers are:     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key     x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5    For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Directory bucket  - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS. SSE-C isn't supported. For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Versioning    If the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes x-amz-delete-marker: true in the response.   If the specified version is a delete marker, the response returns a 405 Method Not Allowed error and the Last-Modified: timestamp response header.

Bucket names must follow the format  bucket_base_name--az-id--x-s3 (for example,  DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access points - When you use this action with an access point, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.   S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form  AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
    ///   - checksumMode: To retrieve the checksum, this parameter must be enabled.  General purpose buckets - If you enable checksum mode and the object is uploaded with a  checksum  and encrypted with an Key Management Service (KMS) key, you must have permission to use the  kms:Decrypt action to retrieve the checksum.  Directory buckets - If you enable ChecksumMode and the object is encrypted with Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS), you must also have the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key to retrieve the checksum of the object.

For characters that aren't supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response. For more information about characters to avoid in object key names, see Object key naming guidelines.  When using the URL encoding type, non-ASCII characters that are used in an object's key name will be percent-encoded according to UTF-8 code values. For example, the object test_file(3).png will appear as test_file%283%29.png.

You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:   Specify the ACL in the request body   Specify permissions using request headers    You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.  Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.  If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. You must use policies to grant access to your bucket and the objects in it. Requests to set ACLs or update ACLs fail and return the AccessControlListNotSupported error code. Requests to read ACLs are still supported. For more information, see Controlling object ownership in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions  You can set access permissions by using one of the following methods:   Specify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account    uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)   US West (Oregon)   Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (São Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-write header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.  x-amz-grant-write: uri="http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery", id="111122223333", id="555566667777"     You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  Grantee Values  You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:   By the person's ID:  <>ID<><>GranteesEmail<>   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request   By URI:  <>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<>    By Email address:  <>Grantees@email.com<>&  The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.

    /// For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  By default, all buckets have a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).     General purpose buckets    You can optionally configure default encryption for a bucket by using server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS).  If you specify default encryption by using SSE-KMS, you can also configure Amazon S3 Bucket Keys. For information about the bucket default encryption feature, see Amazon S3 Bucket Default Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    If you use PutBucketEncryption to set your default bucket encryption to SSE-KMS, you should verify that your KMS key ID is correct. Amazon S3 doesn't validate the KMS key ID provided in PutBucketEncryption requests.      Directory buckets  - You can optionally configure default encryption for a bucket by using server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).   We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your  CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects  are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads.   Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 customer managed key per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket.
    /// The Amazon Web Services managed key (aws/s3) isn't supported.
    ///    S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for GET and PUT operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets
    /// to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through CopyObject, UploadPartCopy, the Copy operation in Batch Operations, or  the import jobs. In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.   When you specify an KMS customer managed key for encryption in your directory bucket, only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported.   For directory buckets, if you use PutBucketEncryption to set your default bucket encryption to SSE-KMS, Amazon S3 validates the KMS key ID provided in PutBucketEncryption requests.       If you're specifying a customer managed KMS key, we recommend using a fully qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias instead, then KMS resolves the key within the requester’s account. This behavior can result in data that's encrypted with a KMS key that belongs to the requester, and not the bucket owner. Also, this action requires Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. For more information, see  Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4).    Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - The s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration permission is required in a policy.  The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation, you must have the s3express:PutEncryptionConfiguration permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide. To set a directory bucket default encryption with SSE-KMS, you must also have the kms:GenerateDataKey and the kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the target KMS key.

    /// This operation configures default encryption  and Amazon S3 Bucket Keys for an existing bucket.   Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Regional endpoint. These endpoints support path-style requests in the format https://s3express-control.region_code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name . Virtual-hosted-style requests aren't supported.
    /// For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  By default, all buckets have a default encryption configuration that uses server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).     General purpose buckets    You can optionally configure default encryption for a bucket by using server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS) or dual-layer server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services KMS keys (DSSE-KMS).  If you specify default encryption by using SSE-KMS, you can also configure Amazon S3 Bucket Keys. For information about the bucket default encryption feature, see Amazon S3 Bucket Default Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    If you use PutBucketEncryption to set your default bucket encryption to SSE-KMS, you should verify that your KMS key ID is correct. Amazon S3 doesn't validate the KMS key ID provided in PutBucketEncryption requests.      Directory buckets  - You can optionally configure default encryption for a bucket by using server-side encryption with Key Management Service (KMS) keys (SSE-KMS).   We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your  CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects  are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads.   Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 customer managed key per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket.
    /// The Amazon Web Services managed key (aws/s3) isn't supported.
    ///    S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for GET and PUT operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled. S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets
    /// to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through CopyObject, UploadPartCopy, the Copy operation in Batch Operations, or  the import jobs. In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.   When you specify an KMS customer managed key for encryption in your directory bucket, only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported.   For directory buckets, if you use PutBucketEncryption to set your default bucket encryption to SSE-KMS, Amazon S3 validates the KMS key ID provided in PutBucketEncryption requests.       If you're specifying a customer managed KMS key, we recommend using a fully qualified KMS key ARN. If you use a KMS key alias instead, then KMS resolves the key within the requester’s account. This behavior can result in data that's encrypted with a KMS key that belongs to the requester, and not the bucket owner. Also, this action requires Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4. For more information, see  Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4).    Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - The s3:PutEncryptionConfiguration permission is required in a policy.  The bucket owner has this permission by default. The bucket owner can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation, you must have the s3express:PutEncryptionConfiguration permission in an IAM identity-based policy instead of a bucket policy. Cross-account access to this API operation isn't supported. This operation can only be performed by the Amazon Web Services account that owns the resource. For more information about directory bucket policies and permissions, see Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide. To set a directory bucket default encryption with SSE-KMS, you must also have the kms:GenerateDataKey and the kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the target KMS key.

A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose additional subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset. To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements: DeleteMarkerReplication, Status, and Priority.  If you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see Backward Compatibility.  For information about enabling versioning on a bucket, see Using Versioning.  Handling Replication of Encrypted Objects  By default, Amazon S3 doesn't replicate objects that are stored at rest using server-side encryption with KMS keys. To replicate Amazon Web Services KMS-encrypted objects, add the following: SourceSelectionCriteria, SseKmsEncryptedObjects, Status, EncryptionConfiguration, and ReplicaKmsKeyID. For information about replication configuration, see Replicating Objects Created with SSE Using KMS keys. For information on PutBucketReplication errors, see List of replication-related error codes   Permissions  To create a PutBucketReplication request, you must have s3:PutReplicationConfiguration permissions for the bucket.   By default, a resource owner, in this case the Amazon Web Services account that created the bucket, can perform this operation. The resource owner can also grant others permissions to perform the operation. For more information about permissions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources.  To perform this operation, the user or role performing the action must have the iam:PassRole permission.

    /// Adds an object to a bucket.    Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket. You cannot use PutObject to only update a single piece of metadata for an existing object. You must put the entire object with updated metadata if you want to update some values.   If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. All objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.    Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. However, Amazon S3 provides features that can modify this behavior:    S3 Object Lock - To prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten, you can use Amazon S3 Object Lock in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.     S3 Versioning - When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all versions of the objects. For each write request that is made to the same object, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID of that object being stored in Amazon S3.  You can retrieve, replace, or delete any version of the object. For more information about versioning, see Adding Objects to Versioning-Enabled Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see GetBucketVersioning.   This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.     Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - The following permissions are required in your policies when your  PutObject request includes specific headers.     s3:PutObject - To successfully complete the PutObject request, you must always have the s3:PutObject permission on a bucket to add an object to it.     s3:PutObjectAcl - To successfully change the objects ACL of your PutObject request, you must have the s3:PutObjectAcl.     s3:PutObjectTagging - To successfully set the tag-set with your PutObject request, you must have the s3:PutObjectTagging.      Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use.

You cannot use PutObject to only update a single piece of metadata for an existing object. You must put the entire object with updated metadata if you want to update some values.   If your bucket uses the bucket owner enforced setting for Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. All objects written to the bucket by any account will be owned by the bucket owner.    Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. However, Amazon S3 provides features that can modify this behavior:    S3 Object Lock - To prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten, you can use Amazon S3 Object Lock in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.     S3 Versioning - When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all versions of the objects. For each write request that is made to the same object, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID of that object being stored in Amazon S3.  You can retrieve, replace, or delete any version of the object. For more information about versioning, see Adding Objects to Versioning-Enabled Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see GetBucketVersioning.   This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.     Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - The following permissions are required in your policies when your  PutObject request includes specific headers.     s3:PutObject - To successfully complete the PutObject request, you must always have the s3:PutObject permission on a bucket to add an object to it.     s3:PutObjectAcl - To successfully change the objects ACL of your PutObject request, you must have the s3:PutObjectAcl.     s3:PutObjectTagging - To successfully set the tag-set with your PutObject request, you must have the s3:PutObjectTagging.      Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use.
    /// Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - acl: The canned ACL to apply to the object. For more information, see Canned ACL in the Amazon S3 User Guide. When adding a new object, you can use headers to grant ACL-based permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If the bucket that you're uploading objects to uses the bucket owner enforced setting for S3 Object Ownership, ACLs are disabled and no longer affect permissions. Buckets that use this setting only accept PUT requests that don't specify an ACL or PUT requests that specify bucket owner full control ACLs, such as the bucket-owner-full-control canned ACL or an equivalent form of this ACL expressed in the XML format. PUT requests that contain other ACLs (for example, custom grants to certain Amazon Web Services accounts) fail and return a 400 error with the error code AccessControlListNotSupported. For more information, see  Controlling ownership of objects and disabling ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.   This functionality is not supported for Amazon S3 on Outposts.
    ///   - body: Object data.
    ///   - bucket: The bucket name to which the PUT action was initiated.   Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format  Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported.  Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Availability Zone. Bucket names must follow the format  bucket_base_name--az-id--x-s3 (for example,  DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access points - When you use this action with an access point, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.   S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form  AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

General purpose buckets - Setting this header to true causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS. Also, specifying this header with a PUT action doesn't affect bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.  Directory buckets - S3 Bucket Keys are always enabled for GET and PUT operations in a directory bucket and can’t be disabled.

Otherwise, Amazon S3 fails the request with the HTTP status code 400 Bad Request. For the x-amz-checksum-algorithm header, replace  algorithm with the supported algorithm from the following list:     CRC32     CRC32C     SHA1     SHA256    For more information, see Checking object integrity in the Amazon S3 User Guide. If the individual checksum value you provide through x-amz-checksum-algorithm doesn't match the checksum algorithm you set through x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm,  Amazon S3 ignores any provided ChecksumAlgorithm parameter and uses the checksum algorithm that matches the provided value in x-amz-checksum-algorithm .  The Content-MD5 or x-amz-sdk-checksum-algorithm header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information, see Uploading objects to an Object Lock enabled bucket in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  For directory buckets, when you use Amazon Web Services SDKs, CRC32 is the default checksum algorithm that's used for performance.

    ///   - serverSideEncryption: The server-side encryption algorithm that was used when you store this object in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms, aws:kms:dsse).    General purpose buckets  - You have four mutually exclusive options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS or DSSE-KMS), and customer-provided keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption by using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest by using server-side encryption with other key options. For more information, see Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (aws:kms). We recommend that the bucket's default encryption uses the desired encryption configuration and you don't override the bucket default encryption in your  CreateSession requests or PUT object requests. Then, new objects  are automatically encrypted with the desired encryption settings. For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For more information about the encryption overriding behaviors in directory buckets, see Specifying server-side encryption with KMS for new object uploads.           In the Zonal endpoint API calls (except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy) using the REST API, the encryption request headers must match the encryption settings that are specified in the CreateSession request.  You can't override the values of the encryption settings (x-amz-server-side-encryption, x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, x-amz-server-side-encryption-context, and x-amz-server-side-encryption-bucket-key-enabled) that are specified in the CreateSession request.  You don't need to explicitly specify these encryption settings values in Zonal endpoint API calls, and    Amazon S3 will use the encryption settings values from the CreateSession request to protect new objects in the directory bucket.    When you use the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs, for CreateSession, the session token refreshes automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. The CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDKs use the bucket's default encryption configuration for the  CreateSession request. It's not supported to override the encryption settings values in the CreateSession request.  So in the Zonal endpoint API calls (except CopyObject and UploadPartCopy),  the encryption request headers must match the default encryption configuration of the directory bucket.
    ///   - sseCustomerAlgorithm: Specifies the algorithm to use when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
    ///   - sseCustomerKey: Specifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
    ///   - sseCustomerKeyMD5: Specifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
    ///   - ssekmsEncryptionContext: Specifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context as an additional encryption context to use for object encryption. The value of this header is a Base64-encoded string of a UTF-8 encoded JSON, which contains the encryption context as key-value pairs.  This value is stored as object metadata and automatically gets passed on to Amazon Web Services KMS for future GetObject operations on this object.  General purpose buckets - This value must be explicitly added during CopyObject operations if you want an additional encryption context for your object. For more information, see Encryption context in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Directory buckets - You can optionally provide an explicit encryption context value. The value must match the default encryption context - the bucket Amazon Resource Name (ARN). An additional encryption context value is not supported.
    ///   - ssekmsKeyId: Specifies the KMS key ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) to use for object encryption. If the KMS key doesn't exist in the same account that's issuing the command, you must use the full Key ARN not the Key ID.  General purpose buckets - If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption with aws:kms or aws:kms:dsse, this header specifies the ID (Key ID, Key ARN, or Key Alias) of the KMS  key to use. If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms or x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms:dsse, but do not provide x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id, Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key (aws/s3) to protect the data.  Directory buckets - If you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption with aws:kms, the  x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id header is implicitly assigned the ID of the KMS  symmetric encryption customer managed key that's configured for your directory bucket's default encryption setting.  If you want to specify the  x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id header explicitly, you can only specify it with the ID (Key ID or Key ARN) of the KMS  customer managed key that's configured for your directory bucket's default encryption setting. Otherwise, you get an HTTP 400 Bad Request error. Only use the key ID or key ARN. The key alias format of the KMS key isn't supported. Your SSE-KMS configuration can only support 1 customer managed key per directory bucket for the lifetime of the bucket.
    ///   - storageClass: By default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    For directory buckets, only the S3 Express One Zone storage class is supported to store newly created objects.   Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class.
    ///   - tagging: The tag-set for the object. The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query parameters. (For example, "Key1=Value1")  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
    ///   - websiteRedirectLocation: If the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL. Amazon S3 stores the value of this header in the object metadata. For information about object metadata, see Object Key and Metadata in the Amazon S3 User Guide. In the following example, the request header sets the redirect to an object (anotherPage.html) in the same bucket:  x-amz-website-redirect-location: /anotherPage.html  In the following example, the request header sets the object redirect to another website:  x-amz-website-redirect-location: http://www.example.com/  For more information about website hosting in Amazon S3, see Hosting Websites on Amazon S3 and How to Configure Website Page Redirects in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL.   Specify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read, x-amz-grant-read-acp, x-amz-grant-write-acp, and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview. You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:    id – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account    uri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group    emailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N. California)   US West (Oregon)   Asia Pacific (Singapore)   Asia Pacific (Sydney)   Asia Pacific (Tokyo)   Europe (Ireland)   South America (São Paulo)   For a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.    For example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants list objects permission to the two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.  x-amz-grant-read: emailAddress="xyz@amazon.com", emailAddress="abc@amazon.com"     You can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.  Grantee Values  You can specify the person (grantee) to whom you're assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:   By the person's ID:  <>ID<><>GranteesEmail<>   DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.   By URI:  <>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<>    By Email address:  <>Grantees@email.com<>lt;/Grantee>  The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.  Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:    US East (N. Virginia)   US West (N.

The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Restoring objects  Objects that you archive to the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, are not accessible in real time. For objects in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. If you want a permanent copy of the object, create a copy of it in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class in your S3 bucket. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify. For objects in the Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers of S3 Intelligent-Tiering, you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version. When restoring an archived object, you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the Tier element of the request body:     Expedited - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for restoring archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.    Standard - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.    Bulk - Bulk retrievals free for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval and S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage classes, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data at no cost. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval Flexible Retrieval storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are also the lowest-cost retrieval option when restoring objects from S3 Glacier Deep Archive. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.    For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for Expedited data access, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see  Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  To get the status of object restoration, you can send a HEAD request. Operations return the x-amz-restore header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications in the Amazon S3 User Guide. After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object. If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration and Object Lifecycle Management in Amazon S3 User Guide.  Responses  A successful action returns either the 200 OK or 202 Accepted status code.    If the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns 202 Accepted in the response.    If the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK in the response.      Special errors:    Code: RestoreAlreadyInProgress     Cause: Object restore is already in progress.

GZIP and BZIP2 are the only compression formats that Amazon S3 Select supports for CSV and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports columnar compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3 Select does not support whole-object compression for Parquet objects.    Server-side encryption - Amazon S3 Select supports querying objects that are protected with server-side encryption. For objects that are encrypted with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), you must use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that are documented in the GetObject. For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) and Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), server-side encryption is handled transparently, so you don't need to specify anything. For more information about server-side encryption, including SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

For more information about permissions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Object Data Formats  You can use Amazon S3 Select to query objects that have the following format properties:    CSV, JSON, and Parquet - Objects must be in CSV, JSON, or Parquet format.    UTF-8 - UTF-8 is the only encoding type Amazon S3 Select supports.    GZIP or BZIP2 - CSV and JSON files can be compressed using GZIP or BZIP2. GZIP and BZIP2 are the only compression formats that Amazon S3 Select supports for CSV and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports columnar compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3 Select does not support whole-object compression for Parquet objects.    Server-side encryption - Amazon S3 Select supports querying objects that are protected with server-side encryption. For objects that are encrypted with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), you must use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that are documented in the GetObject. For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) and Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), server-side encryption is handled transparently, so you don't need to specify anything. For more information about server-side encryption, including SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Working with the Response Body  Given the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select streams the response as a series of messages and includes a Transfer-Encoding header with chunked as its value in the response. For more information, see Appendix: SelectObjectContent Response.  GetObject Support  The SelectObjectContent action does not support the following GetObject functionality. For more information, see GetObject.    Range: Although you can specify a scan range for an Amazon S3 Select request (see SelectObjectContentRequest - ScanRange in the request parameters), you cannot specify the range of bytes of an object to return.    The GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE, and REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage classes, or the ARCHIVE_ACCESS and DEEP_ARCHIVE_ACCESS access tiers of the INTELLIGENT_TIERING storage class: You cannot query objects in the GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE, or REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage classes, nor objects in the ARCHIVE_ACCESS or DEEP_ARCHIVE_ACCESS access tiers of the INTELLIGENT_TIERING storage class. For more information about storage classes, see Using Amazon S3 storage classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

    /// Uploads a part in a multipart upload.  In this operation, you provide new data as a part of an object in your request. However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the UploadPartCopy operation.   You must initiate a multipart upload (see CreateMultipartUpload) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request. Part numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see Multipart upload limits in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.  For more information on multipart uploads, go to Multipart Upload Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide .   Directory buckets - For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Permissions     General purpose bucket permissions - To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Key Management Service key, the requester must have permission to the kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey actions on the key. The requester must also have permissions for the kms:GenerateDataKey action for the CreateMultipartUpload API. Then, the requester needs permissions for the kms:Decrypt action on the UploadPart and UploadPartCopy APIs. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information about KMS permissions, see Protecting data using server-side encryption with KMS in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart upload and permissions and Multipart upload API and permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory bucket permissions - To grant access to this API operation on a directory bucket, we recommend that you use the  CreateSession API operation for session-based authorization. Specifically, you grant the s3express:CreateSession permission to the directory bucket in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy. Then, you make the CreateSession API call on the bucket to obtain a session token. With the session token in your request header, you can make API requests to this operation. After the session token expires, you make another CreateSession API call to generate a new session token for use.
    /// Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs create session and refresh the session token automatically to avoid service interruptions when a session expires. For more information about authorization, see  CreateSession . If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key.    Data integrity   General purpose bucket - To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error. If the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the x-amz-content-sha256 header as a checksum instead of Content-MD5. For more information see Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4).    Directory buckets - MD5 is not supported by directory buckets. You can use checksum algorithms to check object integrity.   Encryption     General purpose bucket - Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You have  mutually exclusive options to protect data using server-side encryption in Amazon S3, depending on how you choose to manage the encryption keys. Specifically, the encryption key options are Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), and Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C). Amazon S3 encrypts data with server-side encryption using Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) by default. You can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption with other key options. The option you use depends on whether you want to use KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or provide your own encryption key (SSE-C). Server-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload operations. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C), you don't need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see CreateMultipartUpload. If you request server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key (SSE-C) in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following request headers.   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key   x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5    For more information, see Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (aws:kms).

Instead of copying data from an existing object as part data, you might use the UploadPart action to upload new data as a part of an object in your request.  You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns the upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request. For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For information about copying objects using a single atomic action vs. a multipart upload, see Operations on Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide.

For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Authentication and authorization  All UploadPartCopy requests must be authenticated and signed by using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source, must be signed. For more information, see REST Authentication.  Directory buckets - You must use IAM credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the UploadPartCopy API operation, instead of using the  temporary security credentials through the CreateSession API operation. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf.  Permissions  You must have READ access to the source object and WRITE access to the destination bucket.    General purpose bucket permissions - You must have the permissions in a policy based on the bucket types of your source bucket and destination bucket in an UploadPartCopy operation.   If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have the  s3:GetObject  permission to read the source object that is being copied.    If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have the  s3:PutObject  permission to write the object copy to the destination bucket.    To perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Key Management Service key, the requester must have permission to the kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey actions on the key. The requester must also have permissions for the kms:GenerateDataKey action for the CreateMultipartUpload API. Then, the requester needs permissions for the kms:Decrypt action on the UploadPart and UploadPartCopy APIs. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information about KMS permissions, see Protecting data using server-side encryption with KMS in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart upload and permissions and Multipart upload API and permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide.      Directory bucket permissions - You must have permissions in a bucket policy or an IAM identity-based policy based on the source and destination bucket types in an UploadPartCopy operation.   If the source object that you want to copy is in a directory bucket, you must have the  s3express:CreateSession permission in the Action element of a policy to read the object. By default, the session is in the ReadWrite mode. If you want to restrict the access, you can explicitly set the s3express:SessionMode condition key to ReadOnly on the copy source bucket.   If the copy destination is a directory bucket, you must have the   s3express:CreateSession permission in the Action element of a policy to write the object to the destination. The s3express:SessionMode condition key cannot be set to ReadOnly on the copy destination.    If the object is encrypted with SSE-KMS, you must also have the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt permissions in IAM identity-based policies and KMS key policies for the KMS key. For example policies, see Example bucket policies for S3 Express One Zone and Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management (IAM) identity-based policies for S3 Express One Zone in the Amazon S3 User Guide.    Encryption     General purpose buckets  -   For information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys with the UploadPartCopy operation, see CopyObject and UploadPart.     Directory buckets  - For directory buckets, there are only two supported options for server-side encryption: server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) (AES256) and server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) (aws:kms). For more information, see Protecting data with server-side encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  For directory buckets, when you perform a CreateMultipartUpload operation and an UploadPartCopy operation,   the request headers you provide in the CreateMultipartUpload request must match the default encryption configuration of the destination bucket.   S3 Bucket Keys aren't supported, when you copy SSE-KMS encrypted objects from general purpose buckets
    /// to directory buckets, from directory buckets to general purpose buckets, or between directory buckets, through UploadPartCopy. In this case, Amazon S3 makes a call to KMS every time a copy request is made for a KMS-encrypted object.

For information about maximum and minimum part sizes and other multipart upload specifications, see Multipart upload limits in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Instead of copying data from an existing object as part data, you might use the UploadPart action to upload new data as a part of an object in your request.  You must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns the upload ID, a unique identifier that you must include in your upload part request. For conceptual information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide. For information about copying objects using a single atomic action vs. a multipart upload, see Operations on Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Directory buckets -  For directory buckets, you must make requests for this API operation to the Zonal endpoint. These endpoints support virtual-hosted-style requests in the format https://bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com/key-name . Path-style requests are not supported. For more information, see Regional and Zonal endpoints in the Amazon S3 User Guide.   Authentication and authorization  All UploadPartCopy requests must be authenticated and signed by using IAM credentials (access key ID and secret access key for the IAM identities). All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source, must be signed. For more information, see REST Authentication.  Directory buckets - You must use IAM credentials to authenticate and authorize your access to the UploadPartCopy API operation, instead of using the  temporary security credentials through the CreateSession API operation. Amazon Web Services CLI or SDKs handles authentication and authorization on your behalf.  Permissions  You must have READ access to the source object and WRITE access to the destination bucket.    General purpose bucket permissions - You must have the permissions in a policy based on the bucket types of your source bucket and destination bucket in an UploadPartCopy operation.   If the source object is in a general purpose bucket, you must have the  s3:GetObject  permission to read the source object that is being copied.    If the destination bucket is a general purpose bucket, you must have the  s3:PutObject  permission to write the object copy to the destination bucket.

Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format  Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported.  Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Availability Zone. Bucket names must follow the format  bucket_base_name--az-id--x-s3 (for example,  DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access points - When you use this action with an access point, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.   S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form  AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
    ///   - copySource: Specifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an access point:   For objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf from the bucket awsexamplebucket, use awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.   For objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format arn:aws:s3:::accesspoint//object/. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through access point my-access-point owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL encoded.    Amazon S3 supports copy operations using Access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services Region.   Access points are not supported by directory buckets.    Alternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:::outpost//object/. For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2, use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf. The value must be URL-encoded.     If your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the current version of the source object to copy.  To copy a specific version of the source object to copy, append ?versionId= to the x-amz-copy-source request header (for example,  x-amz-copy-source: /awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893).  If the current version is a delete marker and you don't specify a versionId in the x-amz-copy-source request header, Amazon S3 returns a 404 Not Found error, because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the x-amz-copy-source and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 Bad Request error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the x-amz-copy-source.    Directory buckets - S3 Versioning isn't enabled and supported for directory buckets.

    ///   - bucket:  Directory buckets - When you use this operation with a directory bucket, you must use virtual-hosted-style requests in the format  Bucket_name.s3express-az_id.region.amazonaws.com. Path-style requests are not supported.  Directory bucket names must be unique in the chosen Availability Zone. Bucket names must follow the format  bucket_base_name--az-id--x-s3 (for example,  DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET--usw2-az1--x-s3). For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Directory bucket naming rules in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access points - When you use this action with an access point, you must provide the alias of the access point in place of the bucket name or specify the access point ARN. When using the access point ARN, you must direct requests to the access point hostname. The access point hostname takes the form AccessPointName-AccountId.s3-accesspoint.Region.amazonaws.com. When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide.  Access points and Object Lambda access points are not supported by directory buckets.   S3 on Outposts - When you use this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form  AccessPointName-AccountId.outpostID.s3-outposts.Region.amazonaws.com. When you use this action with S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see What is S3 on Outposts? in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
    ///   - delimiter: A delimiter is a character that you use to group keys.     Directory buckets - For directory buckets, / is the only supported delimiter.    Directory buckets  - When you query ListObjectsV2 with a delimiter during in-progress multipart uploads, the  CommonPrefixes response parameter contains the prefixes that are associated with the in-progress multipart uploads.  For more information about multipart uploads, see Multipart Upload Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide.
    ///   - encodingType: Encoding type used by Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response. Responses are encoded only in UTF-8. An object key can contain any Unicode character. However, the XML 1.0 parser can't parse certain characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that aren't supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response. For more information about characters to avoid in object key names, see Object key naming guidelines.  When using the URL encoding type, non-ASCII characters that are used in an object's key name will be percent-encoded according to UTF-8 code values. For example, the object test_file(3).png will appear as test_file%283%29.png.
    ///   - expectedBucketOwner: The account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the account ID that you provide does not match the actual owner of the bucket, the request fails with the HTTP status code 403 Forbidden (access denied).
    ///   - fetchOwner: The owner field is not present in ListObjectsV2 by default. If you want to return the owner field with each key in the result, then set the FetchOwner field to true.   Directory buckets - For directory buckets, the bucket owner is returned as the object owner for all objects.
    ///   - maxKeys: Sets the maximum number of keys returned in the response. By default, the action returns up to 1,000 key names. The response might contain fewer keys but will never contain more.
    ///   - optionalObjectAttributes: Specifies the optional fields that you want returned in the response. Fields that you do not specify are not returned.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
    ///   - prefix: Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.   Directory buckets - For directory buckets, only prefixes that end in a delimiter (/) are supported.
    ///   - requestPayer: Confirms that the requester knows that she or he will be charged for the list objects request in V2 style. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests.  This functionality is not supported for directory buckets.
