When a mobile or web app registers with an OpenID Connect provider, they establish a value that identifies the application. This is the value that's sent as the client_id parameter on OAuth requests. You can register multiple client IDs with the same provider. For example, you might have multiple applications that use the same OIDC provider. You cannot register more than 100 client IDs with a single IAM OIDC provider. There is no defined format for a client ID. The CreateOpenIDConnectProviderRequest operation accepts client IDs up to 255 characters long.
    ///   - tags: A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide.  If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request  fails and the resource is not created.
    ///   - thumbprintList: A list of server certificate thumbprints for the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider's server certificates. Typically this list includes only one entry. However, IAM lets you have up to five thumbprints for an OIDC provider. This lets you maintain multiple thumbprints if the identity provider is rotating certificates. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, IAM will retrieve and use the top intermediate certificate authority (CA) thumbprint of the OpenID Connect identity provider server certificate. The server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the X.509 certificate used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. It is always a 40-character string. For example, assume that the OIDC provider is server.example.com and the provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect. In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com.  For more information about obtaining the OIDC provider thumbprint, see Obtaining the thumbprint for an OpenID Connect provider in the IAM user Guide.
    ///   - url: The URL of the identity provider. The URL must begin with https:// and should correspond to the iss claim in the provider's OpenID Connect ID tokens. Per the OIDC standard, path components are allowed but query parameters are not. Typically the URL consists of only a hostname, like https://server.example.org or https://example.com. The URL should not contain a port number.  You cannot register the same provider multiple times in a single Amazon Web Services account.

You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by specifying an entity's path and an optional Organizations policy ID. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service in both report types, the data includes the most recent account activity that the policy allows to account principals in the entity or the entity's children. For important information about the data, reporting period, permissions required, troubleshooting, and supported Regions see Reducing permissions using service last accessed data in the IAM User Guide.  The data includes all attempts to access Amazon Web Services, not just the successful ones. This includes all attempts that were made using the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the Amazon Web Services API through any of the SDKs, or any of the command line tools. An unexpected entry in the service last accessed data does not mean that an account has been compromised, because the request might have been denied. Refer to your CloudTrail logs as the authoritative source for information about all API calls and whether they were successful or denied access. For more information, see Logging IAM events with CloudTrail in the IAM User Guide.  This operation returns a JobId.

This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to any entities in the organization, then the report will return a list of services with no data.    OU – When you specify an OU entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children to which the SCP applies. This means that other accounts outside the OU that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to the OU or one of its children, the report will return a list of services with no data.    management account – When you specify the management account, the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a policy ID in the CLI or API, the policy is ignored. For each service, the report includes data for only the management account.    Account – When you specify another account entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified account. This means that other accounts in the organization that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. If the SCP is not attached to the account, the report will return a list of services with no data.    Service last accessed data does not use other policy types when determining whether a principal could access a service. These other policy types include identity-based policies, resource-based policies, access control lists, IAM permissions boundaries, and STS assume role policies. It only applies SCP logic.

Instead, use ACM to provision, manage, and deploy your server certificates. For more information about IAM server certificates, Working with server certificates in the IAM User Guide.  A tag consists of a key name and an associated value. By assigning tags to your resources, you can do the following:    Administrative grouping and discovery - Attach tags to resources to aid in organization and search. For example, you could search for all resources with the key name Project and the value MyImportantProject. Or search for all resources with the key name Cost Center and the value 41200.     Access control - Include tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only a server certificate that has a specified tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see Control access using IAM tags in the IAM User Guide.    Cost allocation - Use tags to help track which individuals and teams are using which Amazon Web Services resources.      If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request  fails and the resource is not created. For more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide.   Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

For more information, see Permitting IAM users to change their own passwords in the IAM User Guide. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that IAM users in the account do not automatically have permissions to change their own password.
    ///   - hardExpiry:  Prevents IAM users who are accessing the account via the Amazon Web Services Management Console from setting a new console password after their password has expired. The IAM user cannot access the console until an administrator resets the password. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that IAM users can change their passwords after they expire and continue to sign in as the user.  In the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the custom password policy option Allow users to change their own password gives IAM users permissions to iam:ChangePassword for only their user and to the iam:GetAccountPasswordPolicy action. This option does not attach a permissions policy to each user, rather the permissions are applied at the account-level for all users by IAM. IAM users with iam:ChangePassword permission and active access keys can reset their own expired console password using the CLI or API.
    ///   - maxPasswordAge: The number of days that an IAM user password is valid. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of 0. The result is that IAM user passwords never expire.
    ///   - minimumPasswordLength: The minimum number of characters allowed in an IAM user password. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of 6.
    ///   - passwordReusePrevention: Specifies the number of previous passwords that IAM users are prevented from reusing. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of 0. The result is that IAM users are not prevented from reusing previous passwords.
    ///   - requireLowercaseCharacters: Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one lowercase character from the ISO basic Latin alphabet (a to z). If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that passwords do not require at least one lowercase character.
    ///   - requireNumbers: Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one numeric character (0 to 9). If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that passwords do not require at least one numeric character.
    ///   - requireSymbols: Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one of the following non-alphanumeric characters: ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = [ ] { } | ' If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false.

You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account. The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the ResourcePolicy parameter. If you include a ResourcePolicy, then it must be applicable to all of the resources included in the simulation or you receive an invalid input error.

    ///   - resourceHandlingOption: Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that support resource-based policies require different combinations of resources. By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation. Each of the Amazon EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the Amazon EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource.

    ///   - resourceOwner: An ARN representing the Amazon Web Services account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If ResourceOwner is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any ResourcePolicy included in the simulation. If the ResourceOwner parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in CallerArn. This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user CallerArn. The ARN for an account uses the following syntax: arn:aws:iam::AWS-account-ID:root. For example, to represent the account with the 112233445566 ID, use the following ARN: arn:aws:iam::112233445566-ID:root.
