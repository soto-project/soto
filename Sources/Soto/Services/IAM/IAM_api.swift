When a mobile or web app registers with an OpenID Connect provider, they establish a value that identifies the application. This is the value that's sent as the client_id parameter on OAuth requests. You can register multiple client IDs with the same provider. For example, you might have multiple applications that use the same OIDC provider. You cannot register more than 100 client IDs with a single IAM OIDC provider. There is no defined format for a client ID. The CreateOpenIDConnectProviderRequest operation accepts client IDs up to 255 characters long.
    ///   - tags: A list of tags that you want to attach to the new IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. Each tag consists of a key name and an associated value.

If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request  fails and the resource is not created.
    ///   - thumbprintList: A list of server certificate thumbprints for the OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider's server certificates. Typically this list includes only one entry. However, IAM lets you have up to five thumbprints for an OIDC provider. This lets you maintain multiple thumbprints if the identity provider is rotating certificates. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, IAM will retrieve and use the top intermediate certificate authority (CA) thumbprint of the OpenID Connect identity provider server certificate. The server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the X.509 certificate used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. It is always a 40-character string. For example, assume that the OIDC provider is server.example.com and the provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect. In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com.  For more information about obtaining the OIDC provider thumbprint, see Obtaining the thumbprint for an OpenID Connect provider in the IAM user Guide.
    ///   - url: The URL of the identity provider. The URL must begin with https:// and should correspond to the iss claim in the provider's OpenID Connect ID tokens. Per the OIDC standard, path components are allowed but query parameters are not. Typically the URL consists of only a hostname, like https://server.example.org or https://example.com. The URL should not contain a port number.  You cannot register the same provider multiple times in a single Amazon Web Services account.

This operation retrieves the status of your report job and a list of entities that could have used group or policy permissions to access the specified service.    Group – For a group report, this operation returns a list of users in the group that could have used the group’s policies in an attempt to access the service.    Policy – For a policy report, this operation returns a list of entities (users or roles) that could have used the policy in an attempt to access the service.

You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account. You can optionally include a list of one or more additional policies specified as strings to include in the simulation. If you want to simulate only policies specified as strings, use SimulateCustomPolicy instead. You can also optionally include one resource-based policy to be evaluated with each of the resources included in the simulation for IAM users only.

If you do not want users to see other user's permissions, then consider allowing them to use SimulateCustomPolicy instead. Context keys are variables maintained by Amazon Web Services and its services that provide details about the context of an API query request. You can use the Condition element of an IAM policy to evaluate context keys. To get the list of context keys that the policies require for correct simulation, use GetContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy. If the output is long, you can use the MaxItems and Marker parameters to paginate the results.  The IAM policy simulator evaluates statements in the identity-based policy and the inputs that you provide during simulation.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - actionNames: A list of names of API operations to evaluate in the simulation. Each operation is evaluated for each resource. Each operation must include the service identifier, such as iam:CreateUser.
    ///   - callerArn: The ARN of the IAM user that you want to specify as the simulated caller of the API operations. If you do not specify a CallerArn, it defaults to the ARN of the user that you specify in PolicySourceArn, if you specified a user. If you include both a PolicySourceArn (for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/David) and a CallerArn (for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Bob), the result is that you simulate calling the API operations as Bob, as if Bob had David's policies. You can specify only the ARN of an IAM user. You cannot specify the ARN of an assumed role, federated user, or a service principal.  CallerArn is required if you include a ResourcePolicy and the PolicySourceArn is not the ARN for an IAM user. This is required so that the resource-based policy's Principal element has a value to use in evaluating the policy. For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
    ///   - contextEntries: A list of context keys and corresponding values for the simulation to use. Whenever a context key is evaluated in one of the simulated IAM permissions policies, the corresponding value is supplied.
    ///   - marker: Use this parameter only when paginating results and only after  you receive a response indicating that the results are truncated. Set it to the value of the Marker element in the response that you received to indicate where the next call  should start.
    ///   - maxItems: Use this only when paginating results to indicate the  maximum number of items you want in the response. If additional items exist beyond the maximum  you specify, the IsTruncated response element is true. If you do not include this parameter, the number of items defaults to 100. Note that IAM might return fewer results, even when there are more results available. In that case, the IsTruncated response element returns true, and Marker  contains a value to include in the subsequent call that tells the service where to continue  from.
    ///   - permissionsBoundaryPolicyInputList: The IAM permissions boundary policy to simulate. The permissions boundary sets the maximum permissions that the entity can have. You can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. An IAM entity can only have one permissions boundary in effect at a time. For example, if a permissions boundary is attached to an entity and you pass in a different permissions boundary policy using this parameter, then the new permissions boundary policy is used for the simulation. For more information about permissions boundaries, see Permissions boundaries for IAM entities in the IAM User Guide. The policy input is specified as a string containing the complete, valid JSON text of a permissions boundary policy. The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see IAM and STS character quotas. The regex pattern  used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:   Any printable ASCII  character ranging from the space character (\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range   The printable characters in the Basic Latin and  Latin-1 Supplement character set  (through \u00FF)   The special characters tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and  carriage return (\u000D)

If you specify a user, group, or role, the simulation includes all policies that are associated with that entity. If you specify a user, the simulation also includes all policies that are attached to any groups the user belongs to. The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see IAM and STS character quotas. For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.
    ///   - resourceArns: A list of ARNs of Amazon Web Services resources to include in the simulation. If this parameter is not provided, then the value defaults to * (all resources). Each API in the ActionNames parameter is evaluated for each resource in this list. The simulation determines the access result (allowed or denied) of each combination and reports it in the response. You can simulate resources that don't exist in your account. The simulation does not automatically retrieve policies for the specified resources. If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the ResourcePolicy parameter. For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.  Simulation of resource-based policies isn't supported for IAM roles.
    ///   - resourceHandlingOption: Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that support resource-based policies require different combinations of resources. By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation. Each of the Amazon EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the Amazon EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the Amazon EC2 scenario options, see Supported platforms in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.    EC2-VPC-InstanceStore  instance, image, security group, network interface    EC2-VPC-InstanceStore-Subnet  instance, image, security group, network interface, subnet    EC2-VPC-EBS  instance, image, security group, network interface, volume    EC2-VPC-EBS-Subnet  instance, image, security group, network interface, subnet, volume
    ///   - resourceOwner: An Amazon Web Services account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If ResourceOwner is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any ResourcePolicy included in the simulation. If the ResourceOwner parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in CallerArn. This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user CallerArn.
    ///   - resourcePolicy: A resource-based policy to include in the simulation provided as a string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this policy attached. You can include only one resource-based policy in a simulation. The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below.

Access control - Include tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict access to only an IAM customer managed policy that has a specified tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control access, see Control access using IAM tags in the IAM User Guide.      If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the allowed maximum number of tags, then the entire request  fails and the resource is not created. For more information about tagging, see Tagging IAM resources in the IAM User Guide.   Amazon Web Services always interprets the tag Value as a single string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your code.

If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false.

The IAM user cannot access the console until an administrator resets the password. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that IAM users can change their passwords after they expire and continue to sign in as the user.  In the Amazon Web Services Management Console, the custom password policy option Allow users to change their own password gives IAM users permissions to iam:ChangePassword for only their user and to the iam:GetAccountPasswordPolicy action. This option does not attach a permissions policy to each user, rather the permissions are applied at the account-level for all users by IAM. IAM users with iam:ChangePassword permission and active access keys can reset their own expired console password using the CLI or API.
    ///   - maxPasswordAge: The number of days that an IAM user password is valid. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of 0. The result is that IAM user passwords never expire.

    ///   - passwordReusePrevention: Specifies the number of previous passwords that IAM users are prevented from reusing. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of 0. The result is that IAM users are not prevented from reusing previous passwords.
    ///   - requireLowercaseCharacters: Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one lowercase character from the ISO basic Latin alphabet (a to z). If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that passwords do not require at least one lowercase character.
    ///   - requireNumbers: Specifies whether IAM user passwords must contain at least one numeric character (0 to 9). If you do not specify a value for this parameter, then the operation uses the default value of false. The result is that passwords do not require at least one numeric character.

Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate does change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.  Amazon Web Services secures communication with OIDC identity providers (IdPs) using our library of trusted root certificate authorities (CAs) to verify the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint's TLS certificate. If your OIDC IdP relies on a certificate that is not signed by one of these trusted CAs, only then we secure communication using the thumbprints set in the IdP's configuration.   Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider certificate and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint operation to highly privileged users.

The list that you pass with this operation completely replaces the existing list of thumbprints. (The lists are not merged.) Typically, you need to update a thumbprint only when the identity provider certificate changes, which occurs rarely. However, if the provider's certificate does change, any attempt to assume an IAM role that specifies the OIDC provider as a principal fails until the certificate thumbprint is updated.  Amazon Web Services secures communication with OIDC identity providers (IdPs) using our library of trusted root certificate authorities (CAs) to verify the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint's TLS certificate. If your OIDC IdP relies on a certificate that is not signed by one of these trusted CAs, only then we secure communication using the thumbprints set in the IdP's configuration.   Trust for the OIDC provider is derived from the provider certificate and is validated by the thumbprint. Therefore, it is best to limit access to the UpdateOpenIDConnectProviderThumbprint operation to highly privileged users.

    ///   - path: The path for the server certificate. For more information about paths, see IAM identifiers in the IAM User Guide. This parameter is optional. If it is not included, it defaults to a slash (/). This parameter allows (through its regex pattern) a string of characters consisting  of either a forward slash (/) by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through the DEL character (\u007F), including  most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.  If you are uploading a server certificate specifically for use with Amazon CloudFront distributions, you must specify a path using the path parameter. The path must begin with /cloudfront and must include a trailing slash (for example, /cloudfront/test/).

If you want to include a resource policy in the simulation, then you must include the policy as a string in the ResourcePolicy parameter. For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.  Simulation of resource-based policies isn't supported for IAM roles.
    ///   - resourceHandlingOption: Specifies the type of simulation to run. Different API operations that support resource-based policies require different combinations of resources. By specifying the type of simulation to run, you enable the policy simulator to enforce the presence of the required resources to ensure reliable simulation results. If your simulation does not match one of the following scenarios, then you can omit this parameter. The following list shows each of the supported scenario values and the resources that you must define to run the simulation. Each of the Amazon EC2 scenarios requires that you specify instance, image, and security group resources. If your scenario includes an EBS volume, then you must specify that volume as a resource. If the Amazon EC2 scenario includes VPC, then you must supply the network interface resource. If it includes an IP subnet, then you must specify the subnet resource. For more information on the Amazon EC2 scenario options, see Supported platforms in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.    EC2-VPC-InstanceStore  instance, image, security group, network interface    EC2-VPC-InstanceStore-Subnet  instance, image, security group, network interface, subnet    EC2-VPC-EBS  instance, image, security group, network interface, volume    EC2-VPC-EBS-Subnet  instance, image, security group, network interface, subnet, volume
    ///   - resourceOwner: An Amazon Web Services account ID that specifies the owner of any simulated resource that does not identify its owner in the resource ARN. Examples of resource ARNs include an S3 bucket or object. If ResourceOwner is specified, it is also used as the account owner of any ResourcePolicy included in the simulation. If the ResourceOwner parameter is not specified, then the owner of the resources and the resource policy defaults to the account of the identity provided in CallerArn. This parameter is required only if you specify a resource-based policy and account that owns the resource is different from the account that owns the simulated calling user CallerArn.
    ///   - resourcePolicy: A resource-based policy to include in the simulation provided as a string. Each resource in the simulation is treated as if it had this policy attached. You can include only one resource-based policy in a simulation. The maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. To view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see IAM and STS character quotas. The regex pattern  used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:   Any printable ASCII  character ranging from the space character (\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range   The printable characters in the Basic Latin and  Latin-1 Supplement character set  (through \u00FF)   The special characters tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and  carriage return (\u000D)    Simulation of resource-based policies isn't supported for IAM roles.
