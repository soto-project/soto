You can generate a service last accessed data report for entities by specifying only the entity's path. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by any service control policies (SCPs) that apply to the entity. You can generate a service last accessed data report for a policy by specifying an entity's path and an optional Organizations policy ID. This data includes a list of services that are allowed by the specified SCP.

To check the status of this request, use the JobId parameter in the  GetOrganizationsAccessReport  operation and test the JobStatus response parameter. When the job is complete, you can retrieve the report. To generate a service last accessed data report for entities, specify an entity path without specifying the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned in the report.    Root – When you specify the organizations root as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to your root. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization except the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs.    OU – When you specify an organizational unit (OU) as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the OU and its parents. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children. This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs.    management account – When you specify the management account, the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the management account is not limited by SCPs.

Account – When you specify another account as the entity, the resulting report lists all of the services allowed by SCPs that are attached to the account and its parents. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified account.   To generate a service last accessed data report for policies, specify an entity path and the optional Organizations policy ID. The type of entity that you specify determines the data returned for each service.    Root – When you specify the root entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in your organization to which the SCP applies. This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to any entities in the organization, then the report will return a list of services with no data.    OU – When you specify an OU entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for all accounts in the OU or its children to which the SCP applies. This means that other accounts outside the OU that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. This data excludes the management account, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If the SCP is not attached to the OU or one of its children, the report will return a list of services with no data.    management account – When you specify the management account, the resulting report lists all Amazon Web Services services, because the management account is not limited by SCPs. If you specify a policy ID in the CLI or API, the policy is ignored. For each service, the report includes data for only the management account.    Account – When you specify another account entity and a policy ID, the resulting report lists all of the services that are allowed by the specified SCP. For each service, the report includes data for only the specified account. This means that other accounts in the organization that are affected by the SCP might not be included in the data. If the SCP is not attached to the account, the report will return a list of services with no data.

For each service, the response includes information about the most recent access attempt. The JobId returned by GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetail must be used by the same role within a session, or by the same user when used to call GetServiceLastAccessedDetail.    GetServiceLastAccessedDetailsWithEntities – Use this operation for groups and policies to list information about the associated entities (users or roles) that attempted to access a specific Amazon Web Services service.    To check the status of the GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails request, use the JobId parameter in the same operations and test the JobStatus response parameter. For additional information about the permissions policies that allow an identity (user, group, or role) to access specific services, use the ListPoliciesGrantingServiceAccess operation.
