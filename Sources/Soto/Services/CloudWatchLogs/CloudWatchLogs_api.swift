/// Service object for interacting with AWS CloudWatchLogs service.

/// You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and other sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch console. Alternatively, you can use CloudWatch Logs commands in the Amazon Web Services CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs SDK. You can use CloudWatch Logs to:    Monitor logs from EC2 instances in real time: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs. Then, it can send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as "NullReferenceException"). You can also count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify.    Monitor CloudTrail logged events: You can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to perform troubleshooting.    Archive log data: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage. You can change the log retention setting so that any log events earlier than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent helps to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.

After a KMS key is associated with a log group, all newly ingested data for the log group is encrypted using the KMS key. This association is stored as long as the data encrypted with the KMS keyis still within CloudWatch Logs. This enables CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data whenever it is requested.  CloudWatch Logs supports only symmetric KMS keys. Do not use an associate an asymmetric KMS key with your log group. For more information, see Using Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys.  It can take up to 5 minutes for this operation to take effect. If you attempt to associate a KMS key with a log group but the KMS key does not exist or the KMS key is disabled, you receive an InvalidParameterException error.

Exporting log data to S3 buckets that are encrypted by KMS is supported. Exporting log data to Amazon S3 buckets that have S3 Object Lock enabled with a retention period is also supported. Exporting to S3 buckets that are encrypted with AES-256 is supported.  This is an asynchronous call. If all the required information is provided, this  operation initiates an export task and responds with the ID of the task. After the task has started, you can use DescribeExportTasks to get the status of the export task. Each account can only have one active (RUNNING or PENDING) export task at a time. To cancel an export task, use CancelExportTask. You can export logs from multiple log groups or multiple time ranges to the same S3 bucket. To separate log data for each export task, specify a prefix to be used as the Amazon S3 key prefix for all exported objects.  Time-based sorting on chunks of log data inside an exported file is not guaranteed. You can sort the exported log field data by using Linux utilities.
