/// Service object for interacting with AWS SQS service.

/// Welcome to the Amazon SQS API Reference. Amazon SQS is a reliable, highly-scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between applications or microservices. Amazon SQS moves data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components. For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see Identity and access management in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.  You can use Amazon Web Services SDKs to access Amazon SQS using your favorite programming language. The SDKs perform tasks such as the following automatically:   Cryptographically sign your service requests   Retry requests   Handle error responses    Additional information     Amazon SQS Product Page     Amazon SQS Developer Guide     Making API Requests     Amazon SQS Message Attributes     Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues       Amazon SQS in the Command Line Interface      Amazon Web Services General Reference     Regions and Endpoints

    /// Adds a permission to a queue for a specific principal. This allows sharing access to the queue. When you create a queue, you have full control access rights for the queue. Only you, the owner of the queue, can grant or deny permissions to the queue. For more information about these permissions, see Allow Developers to Write Messages to a Shared Queue in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.     AddPermission generates a policy for you. You can use  SetQueueAttributes to upload your policy. For more information, see Using Custom Policies with the Amazon SQS Access Policy Language in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.   An Amazon SQS policy can have a maximum of seven actions per statement.   To remove the ability to change queue permissions, you must deny permission to the AddPermission, RemovePermission, and SetQueueAttributes actions in your IAM policy.   Amazon SQS AddPermission does not support adding a non-account principal.     Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action.

In this context, the source queue is the dead-letter queue (DLQ), while the destination queue can be the original source queue (from which the messages were driven to the dead-letter-queue), or a custom destination queue.

    /// Changes the visibility timeout of a specified message in a queue to a new value. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours. For more information, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. For example, if the default timeout for a queue is 60 seconds, 15 seconds have elapsed since you received the message, and you send a ChangeMessageVisibility call with VisibilityTimeout set to 10 seconds, the 10 seconds begin to count from the time that you make the ChangeMessageVisibility call. Thus, any attempt to change the visibility timeout or to delete that message 10 seconds after you initially change the visibility timeout (a total of 25 seconds) might result in an error. An Amazon SQS message has three basic states:   Sent to a queue by a producer.   Received from the queue by a consumer.   Deleted from the queue.   A message is considered to be stored after it is sent to a queue by a producer, but not yet received from the queue by a consumer (that is, between states 1 and 2). There is no limit to the number of stored messages. A message is considered to be in flight after it is received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue (that is, between states 2 and 3). There is a limit to the number of in flight messages. Limits that apply to in flight messages are unrelated to the unlimited number of stored messages. For most standard queues (depending on queue traffic and message backlog), there can be a maximum of approximately 120,000 in flight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the OverLimit error message. To avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages from the queue after they're processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process your messages. To request a limit increase, file a support request. For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 20,000 in flight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error messages.  If you attempt to set the VisibilityTimeout to a value greater than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum remaining time. Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn't saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the original timeout value (not to the value you set using the ChangeMessageVisibility action) the next time the message is received.

    /// Creates a new standard or FIFO queue. You can pass one or more attributes in the request. Keep the following in mind:   If you don't specify the FifoQueue attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue.  You can't change the queue type after you create it and you can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. You must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue. For more information, see Moving From a Standard Queue to a FIFO Queue in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.     If you don't provide a value for an attribute, the queue is created with the default value for the attribute.   If you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before creating a queue with the same name.   To successfully create a new queue, you must provide a queue name that adheres to the limits related to queues and is unique within the scope of your queues.  After you create a queue, you must wait at least one second after the queue is created to be able to use the queue.  To get the queue URL, use the  GetQueueUrl action.  GetQueueUrl requires only the QueueName parameter. be aware of existing queue names:   If you provide the name of an existing queue along with the exact names and values of all the queue's attributes, CreateQueue returns the queue URL for the existing queue.   If the queue name, attribute names, or attribute values don't match an existing queue, CreateQueue returns an error.    Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action.

Amazon SQS can delete a message from a queue even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue longer than the retention period configured for the queue.   The ReceiptHandle is associated with a specific instance of receiving a message. If you receive a message more than once, the ReceiptHandle is different each time you receive a message. When you use the DeleteMessage action, you must provide the most recently received ReceiptHandle for the message (otherwise, the request succeeds, but the message will not be deleted). For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.

For more information, see Amazon SQS Long Polling in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.  Short poll is the default behavior where a weighted random set of machines is sampled on a ReceiveMessage call. Thus, only the messages on the sampled machines are returned. If the number of messages in the queue is small (fewer than 1,000), you most likely get fewer messages than you requested per ReceiveMessage call. If the number of messages in the queue is extremely small, you might not receive any messages in a particular ReceiveMessage response. If this happens, repeat the request.  For each message returned, the response includes the following:   The message body.   An MD5 digest of the message body. For information about MD5, see RFC1321.   The MessageId you received when you sent the message to the queue.   The receipt handle.   The message attributes.   An MD5 digest of the message attributes.   The receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the message. For more information, see Queue and Message Identifiers in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. You can provide the VisibilityTimeout parameter in your request. The parameter is applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the response. If you don't include the parameter, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is used for the returned messages. For more information, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. A message that isn't deleted or a message whose visibility isn't extended before the visibility timeout expires counts as a failed receive. Depending on the configuration of the queue, the message might be sent to the dead-letter queue.  In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.
