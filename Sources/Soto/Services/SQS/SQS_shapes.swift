    public struct CreateQueueRequest: AWSEncodableShape {
        /// A map of attributes with their corresponding values. The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the CreateQueue action uses:    DelaySeconds – The length of time, in seconds, for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Default: 0.     MaximumMessageSize – The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default: 262,144 (256 KiB).     MessageRetentionPeriod – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer from 60 seconds (1 minute) to 1,209,600 seconds (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days). When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the MessageRetentionPeriod attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the MessageRetentionPeriod is reduced below the age of existing messages.    Policy – The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy. For more information about policy structure, see Overview of Amazon Web Services IAM Policies in the IAM User Guide.     ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds – The length of time, in seconds, for which a  ReceiveMessage action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.     VisibilityTimeout – The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.   The following attributes apply only to dead-letter queues:     RedrivePolicy – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality  of the source queue as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:    deadLetterTargetArn – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to  which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.    maxReceiveCount – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being  moved to the dead-letter queue. Default: 10. When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount  for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue.      RedriveAllowPolicy – The string that includes the parameters for the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive permission and which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:    redrivePermission – The permission type that defines which source queues can  specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue. Valid values are:    allowAll – (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web Services account in the same Region can  specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.    denyAll – No source queues can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.    byQueue – Only queues specified by the sourceQueueArns parameter can specify  this queue as the dead-letter queue.      sourceQueueArns – The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source queues that can specify  this queue as the dead-letter queue and redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the  redrivePermission parameter is set to byQueue. You can specify up to 10 source queue ARNs.  To allow more than 10 source queues to specify dead-letter queues, set the redrivePermission parameter to allowAll.      The dead-letter queue of a  FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter  queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.  The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption:    KmsMasterKeyId – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms. While the alias of the Amazon Web Services managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always alias/aws/sqs, the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be alias/MyAlias . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Management Service API Reference.     KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?     SqsManagedSseEnabled – Enables server-side queue encryption using SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is supported per queue (for example, SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS).   The following attributes apply only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues:    FifoQueue – Designates a queue as FIFO. Valid values are true and false. If you don't specify the FifoQueue attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue. You can provide this attribute only during queue creation. You can't change it for an existing queue. When you set this attribute, you must also provide the MessageGroupId for your messages explicitly. For more information, see FIFO queue logic in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.    ContentBasedDeduplication – Enables content-based deduplication. Valid values are true and false. For more information, see Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. Note the following:    Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId.   You may provide a MessageDeduplicationId explicitly.   If you aren't able to provide a MessageDeduplicationId and you enable ContentBasedDeduplication for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).    If you don't provide a MessageDeduplicationId and the queue doesn't have ContentBasedDeduplication set, the action fails with an error.   If the queue has ContentBasedDeduplication set, your MessageDeduplicationId overrides the generated one.     When ContentBasedDeduplication is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.   If you send one message with ContentBasedDeduplication enabled and then another message with a MessageDeduplicationId that is the same as the one generated for the first MessageDeduplicationId, the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.      The following attributes apply only to
        /// high throughput
        /// for FIFO queues:    DeduplicationScope – Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the  message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup and queue.    FifoThroughputLimit – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput  quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are perQueue and perMessageGroupId.  The perMessageGroupId value is allowed only when the value for DeduplicationScope is messageGroup.   To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:   Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup.   Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId.   If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified. For information on throughput quotas,  see Quotas related to messages  in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.
        public let attributes: [QueueAttributeName: String]?
        /// The name of the new queue. The following limits apply to this name:   A queue name can have up to 80 characters.   Valid values: alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), and underscores (_).   A FIFO queue name must end with the .fifo suffix.   Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed – Returns the approximate number of messages in the queue that are delayed and not available for reading immediately. This can happen when the queue is configured as a delay queue or when a message has been sent with a delay parameter.    ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible – Returns the approximate number of messages that are in flight. Messages are considered to be in flight if they have been sent to a client but have not yet been deleted or have not yet reached the end of their visibility window.     CreatedTimestamp – Returns the time when the queue was created in seconds (epoch time).    DelaySeconds – Returns the default delay on the queue in seconds.    LastModifiedTimestamp – Returns the time when the queue was last changed in seconds (epoch time).    MaximumMessageSize – Returns the limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it.    MessageRetentionPeriod – Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the MessageRetentionPeriod attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the MessageRetentionPeriod is reduced below the age of existing messages.    Policy – Returns the policy of the queue.    QueueArn – Returns the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the queue.    ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds – Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which the ReceiveMessage action waits for a message to arrive.     VisibilityTimeout – Returns the visibility timeout for the queue. For more information about the visibility timeout, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.    The following attributes apply only to dead-letter queues:     RedrivePolicy – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality  of the source queue as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:    deadLetterTargetArn – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to  which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.    maxReceiveCount – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being  moved to the dead-letter queue. Default: 10. When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount  for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue.      RedriveAllowPolicy – The string that includes the parameters for the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive permission and which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:    redrivePermission – The permission type that defines which source queues can  specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue. Valid values are:    allowAll – (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web Services account in the same Region can  specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.    denyAll – No source queues can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.    byQueue – Only queues specified by the sourceQueueArns parameter can specify  this queue as the dead-letter queue.      sourceQueueArns – The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source queues that can specify  this queue as the dead-letter queue and redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the  redrivePermission parameter is set to byQueue. You can specify up to 10 source queue ARNs.  To allow more than 10 source queues to specify dead-letter queues, set the redrivePermission parameter to allowAll.      The dead-letter queue of a  FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter  queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.  The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption:    KmsMasterKeyId – Returns the ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms.     KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds – Returns the length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. For more information, see How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?.     SqsManagedSseEnabled – Returns information about whether the queue is using SSE-SQS encryption using SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is supported per queue (for example, SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS).   The following attributes apply only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues:    FifoQueue – Returns information about whether the queue is FIFO. For more information, see FIFO queue logic in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.  To determine whether a queue is FIFO, you can check whether QueueName ends with the .fifo suffix.     ContentBasedDeduplication – Returns whether content-based deduplication is enabled for the queue. For more information, see Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.    The following attributes apply only to
        /// high throughput
        /// for FIFO queues:    DeduplicationScope – Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the  message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup and queue.    FifoThroughputLimit – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput  quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are perQueue and perMessageGroupId.  The perMessageGroupId value is allowed only when the value for DeduplicationScope is messageGroup.   To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:   Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup.   Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId.   If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified. For information on throughput quotas,  see Quotas related to messages  in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.

        public let queueUrl: String
        /// This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues. The token used for deduplication of ReceiveMessage calls. If a networking issue occurs after a ReceiveMessage action, and instead of a response you receive a generic error, it is possible to retry the same action with an identical ReceiveRequestAttemptId to retrieve the same set of messages, even if their visibility timeout has not yet expired.   You can use ReceiveRequestAttemptId only for 5 minutes after a ReceiveMessage action.   When you set FifoQueue, a caller of the ReceiveMessage action can provide a ReceiveRequestAttemptId explicitly.   It is possible to retry the ReceiveMessage action with the same ReceiveRequestAttemptId if none of the messages have been modified (deleted or had their visibility changes).   During a visibility timeout, subsequent calls with the same ReceiveRequestAttemptId return the same messages and receipt handles. If a retry occurs within the deduplication interval, it resets the visibility timeout. For more information, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.  If a caller of the ReceiveMessage action still processes messages when the visibility timeout expires and messages become visible, another worker consuming from the same queue can receive the same messages and therefore process duplicates. Also, if a consumer whose message processing time is longer than the visibility timeout tries to delete the processed messages, the action fails with an error. To mitigate this effect, ensure that your application observes a safe threshold before the visibility timeout expires and extend the visibility timeout as necessary.    While messages with a particular MessageGroupId are invisible, no more messages belonging to the same MessageGroupId are returned until the visibility timeout expires. You can still receive messages with another MessageGroupId as long as it is also visible.   If a caller of ReceiveMessage can't track the ReceiveRequestAttemptId, no retries work until the original visibility timeout expires. As a result, delays might occur but the messages in the queue remain in a strict order.   The maximum length of ReceiveRequestAttemptId is 128 characters. ReceiveRequestAttemptId can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;?@[\]^_`{|}~). For best practices of using ReceiveRequestAttemptId, see Using the ReceiveRequestAttemptId Request Parameter in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.
        public let receiveRequestAttemptId: String?
        /// The duration (in seconds) that the received messages are hidden from subsequent retrieve requests after being retrieved by a ReceiveMessage request. If not specified, the default visibility timeout for the queue is used, which is 30 seconds. Understanding VisibilityTimeout:   When a message is received from a queue, it becomes temporarily invisible to other consumers for the duration of the visibility timeout. This prevents multiple consumers from processing the same message simultaneously. If the message is not deleted or its visibility timeout is not extended before the timeout expires, it becomes visible again and can be retrieved by other consumers.   Setting an appropriate visibility timeout is crucial. If it's too short, the message might become visible again before processing is complete, leading to duplicate processing. If it's too long, it delays the reprocessing of messages if the initial processing fails.   You can adjust the visibility timeout using the --visibility-timeout parameter in the receive-message command to match the processing time required by your application.   A message that isn't deleted or a message whose visibility isn't extended before the visibility timeout expires counts as a failed receive. Depending on the configuration of the queue, the message might be sent to the dead-letter queue.   For more information, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.
        public let visibilityTimeout: Int?
        /// The duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a message to arrive in the queue before returning. If a message is available, the call returns sooner than WaitTimeSeconds.

If you are using the Java SDK, it returns a ReceiveMessageResponse object, which has a empty list instead of a Null object.  To avoid HTTP errors, ensure that the HTTP response timeout for ReceiveMessage requests is longer than the WaitTimeSeconds parameter. For example, with the Java SDK, you can set HTTP transport settings using the  NettyNioAsyncHttpClient for asynchronous clients, or the  ApacheHttpClient for synchronous clients.

    public struct SetQueueAttributesRequest: AWSEncodableShape {
        /// A map of attributes to set. The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the special request parameters that the SetQueueAttributes action uses:    DelaySeconds – The length of time, in seconds, for which the delivery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 900 (15 minutes). Default: 0.     MaximumMessageSize – The limit of how many bytes a message can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from 1,024 bytes (1 KiB) up to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB). Default: 262,144 (256 KiB).     MessageRetentionPeriod – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer representing seconds, from 60 (1 minute) to 1,209,600 (14 days). Default: 345,600 (4 days). When you change a queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds for most of the attributes to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes made to the MessageRetentionPeriod attribute can take up to 15 minutes and will impact existing messages in the queue potentially causing them to be expired and deleted if the MessageRetentionPeriod is reduced below the age of existing messages.    Policy – The queue's policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy. For more information about policy structure, see Overview of Amazon Web Services IAM Policies in the Identity and Access Management User Guide.     ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds – The length of time, in seconds, for which a  ReceiveMessage action waits for a message to arrive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.     VisibilityTimeout – The visibility timeout for the queue, in seconds. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). Default: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.   The following attributes apply only to dead-letter queues:     RedrivePolicy – The string that includes the parameters for the dead-letter queue functionality  of the source queue as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:    deadLetterTargetArn – The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dead-letter queue to  which Amazon SQS moves messages after the value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.    maxReceiveCount – The number of times a message is delivered to the source queue before being  moved to the dead-letter queue. Default: 10. When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount  for a queue, Amazon SQS moves the message to the dead-letter-queue.      RedriveAllowPolicy – The string that includes the parameters for the permissions for the dead-letter queue redrive permission and which source queues can specify dead-letter queues as a JSON object. The parameters are as follows:    redrivePermission – The permission type that defines which source queues can  specify the current queue as the dead-letter queue. Valid values are:    allowAll – (Default) Any source queues in this Amazon Web Services account in the same Region can  specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.    denyAll – No source queues can specify this queue as the dead-letter queue.    byQueue – Only queues specified by the sourceQueueArns parameter can specify  this queue as the dead-letter queue.      sourceQueueArns – The Amazon Resource Names (ARN)s of the source queues that can specify  this queue as the dead-letter queue and redrive messages. You can specify this parameter only when the  redrivePermission parameter is set to byQueue. You can specify up to 10 source queue ARNs.  To allow more than 10 source queues to specify dead-letter queues, set the redrivePermission parameter to allowAll.      The dead-letter queue of a  FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue. Similarly, the dead-letter  queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue.  The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption:    KmsMasterKeyId – The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more information, see Key Terms. While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always alias/aws/sqs, the alias of a custom CMK can, for example, be alias/MyAlias . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Management Service API Reference.     KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds – The length of time, in seconds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt messages before calling KMS again. An integer representing seconds, between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). Default: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better security but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges after Free Tier. For more information, see How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work?.     SqsManagedSseEnabled – Enables server-side queue encryption using SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption option is supported per queue (for example, SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS).   The following attribute applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues:    ContentBasedDeduplication – Enables content-based deduplication. For more information, see Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide. Note the following:    Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId.   You may provide a MessageDeduplicationId explicitly.   If you aren't able to provide a MessageDeduplicationId and you enable ContentBasedDeduplication for your queue, Amazon SQS uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the body of the message (but not the attributes of the message).    If you don't provide a MessageDeduplicationId and the queue doesn't have ContentBasedDeduplication set, the action fails with an error.   If the queue has ContentBasedDeduplication set, your MessageDeduplicationId overrides the generated one.     When ContentBasedDeduplication is in effect, messages with identical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.   If you send one message with ContentBasedDeduplication enabled and then another message with a MessageDeduplicationId that is the same as the one generated for the first MessageDeduplicationId, the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.      The following attributes apply only to
        /// high throughput
        /// for FIFO queues:    DeduplicationScope – Specifies whether message deduplication occurs at the  message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup and queue.    FifoThroughputLimit – Specifies whether the FIFO queue throughput  quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid values are perQueue and perMessageGroupId.  The perMessageGroupId value is allowed only when the value for DeduplicationScope is messageGroup.   To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:   Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup.   Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId.   If you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown for enabling high throughput, normal throughput is in effect and deduplication occurs as specified. For information on throughput quotas,  see Quotas related to messages  in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.
