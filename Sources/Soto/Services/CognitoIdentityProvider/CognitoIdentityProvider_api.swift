/// Service object for interacting with AWS CognitoIdentityProvider service.
///
/// With the Amazon Cognito user pools API, you can configure user pools and authenticate users. To authenticate users from third-party identity providers (IdPs) in this API, you can link IdP users to native user profiles. Learn more about the authentication and authorization of federated users at Adding user pool sign-in through a third party and in the User pool federation endpoints and managed login reference. This API reference provides detailed information about API operations and object types in Amazon Cognito. Along with resource management operations, the Amazon Cognito user pools API includes classes of operations and authorization models for client-side and server-side authentication of users. You can interact with operations in the Amazon Cognito user pools API as any of the following subjects.   An administrator who wants to configure user pools, app clients, users, groups, or other user pool functions.   A server-side app, like a web application, that wants to use its Amazon Web Services privileges to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.   A client-side app, like a mobile app, that wants to make unauthenticated requests to manage, authenticate, or authorize a user.   For more information, see Understanding API, OIDC, and managed login pages authentication in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide. With your Amazon Web Services SDK, you can build the logic to support operational flows in every use case for this API. You can also make direct REST API requests to Amazon Cognito user pools service endpoints. The following links can get you started with the CognitoIdentityProvider client in supported Amazon Web Services SDKs. To get started with an Amazon Web Services SDK, see Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services. For example actions and scenarios, see Code examples for Amazon Cognito Identity Provider using Amazon Web Services SDKs.

If this parameter is set to True and the phone number or email address specified in the UserAttributes parameter already exists as an alias with a different user, this request migrates the alias from the previous user to the newly-created user. The previous user will no longer be able to log in using that alias. If this parameter is set to False, the API throws an AliasExistsException error if the alias already exists. The default value is False.
    ///   - messageAction: Set to RESEND to resend the invitation message to a user that already exists, and to reset the temporary-password duration with a new temporary password. Set to SUPPRESS to suppress sending the message. You can specify only one value.
    ///   - temporaryPassword: The user's temporary password. This password must conform to the password policy that you specified when you created the user pool. The exception to the requirement for a password is when your user pool supports passwordless sign-in with email or SMS OTPs. To create a user with no password, omit this parameter or submit a blank value. You can only create a passwordless user when passwordless sign-in is available. The temporary password is valid only once. To complete the Admin Create User flow, the user must enter the temporary password in the sign-in page, along with a new password to be used in all future sign-ins. If you don't specify a value, Amazon Cognito generates one for you unless you have passwordless options active for your user pool. The temporary password can only be used until the user account expiration limit that you set for your user pool. To reset the account after that time limit, you must call AdminCreateUser again and specify RESEND for the MessageAction parameter.
    ///   - userAttributes: An array of name-value pairs that contain user attributes and attribute values to be set for the user to be created. You can create a user without specifying any attributes other than Username. However, any attributes that you specify as required (when creating a user pool or in the Attributes tab of the console) either you should supply (in your call to AdminCreateUser) or the user should supply (when they sign up in response to your welcome message). For custom attributes, you must prepend the custom: prefix to the attribute name. To send a message inviting the user to sign up, you must specify the user's email address or phone number. You can do this in your call to AdminCreateUser or in the Users tab of the Amazon Cognito console for managing your user pools. You must also provide an email address or phone number when you expect the user to do passwordless sign-in with an email or SMS OTP. These attributes must be provided when passwordless options are the only available, or when you don't submit a TemporaryPassword. In your AdminCreateUser request, you can set the email_verified and phone_number_verified attributes to true. The following conditions apply:  email  The email address where you want the user to receive their confirmation code and username.

    /// Starts sign-in for applications with a server-side component, for example a traditional web application. This operation specifies the authentication flow that you'd like to begin. The authentication flow that you specify must be supported in your app client configuration. For more information about authentication flows, see Authentication flows.  This action might generate an SMS text message. Starting June 1, 2021, US telecom carriers require you to register an origination phone number before you can send SMS messages to US phone numbers. If you use SMS text messages in Amazon Cognito, you must register a phone number with Amazon Pinpoint. Amazon Cognito uses the registered number automatically. Otherwise, Amazon Cognito users who must receive SMS messages might not be able to sign up, activate their accounts, or sign in. If you have never used SMS text messages with Amazon Cognito or any other Amazon Web Services service, Amazon Simple Notification Service might place your account in the SMS sandbox. In  sandbox mode , you can send messages only to verified phone numbers. After you test your app while in the sandbox environment, you can move out of the sandbox and into production. For more information, see  SMS message settings for Amazon Cognito user pools in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.

    ///   - analyticsMetadata: Information that supports analytics outcomes with Amazon Pinpoint, including the
    ///   - authFlow: The authentication flow that you want to initiate. Each AuthFlow has linked AuthParameters that you must submit. The following are some example flows.  USER_AUTH  The entry point for choice-based authentication with passwords, one-time passwords, and WebAuthn authenticators. Request a preferred authentication type or review available authentication types. From the offered authentication types, select one in a challenge response and then authenticate with that method in an additional challenge response. To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the  Essentials tier or higher.  USER_SRP_AUTH  Username-password authentication with the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol. For more information, see Use SRP password verification in custom authentication flow.  REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH and REFRESH_TOKEN  Receive new ID and access tokens when you pass a REFRESH_TOKEN parameter with a valid refresh token as the value. For more information, see Using the refresh token.  CUSTOM_AUTH  Custom authentication with Lambda triggers. For more information, see Custom authentication challenge Lambda triggers.  ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH  Server-side username-password authentication with the password sent directly in the request. For more information about client-side and server-side authentication, see SDK authorization models.
    ///   - authParameters: The authentication parameters. These are inputs corresponding to the AuthFlow that you're invoking. The required values depend on the value of AuthFlow for example:   For USER_AUTH: USERNAME (required), PREFERRED_CHALLENGE. If you don't provide a value for PREFERRED_CHALLENGE, Amazon Cognito responds with the AvailableChallenges parameter that specifies the available sign-in methods.   For USER_SRP_AUTH: USERNAME (required), SRP_A (required), SECRET_HASH (required if the app client is configured with a client secret), DEVICE_KEY.   For ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH: USERNAME (required), PASSWORD (required), SECRET_HASH (required if the app client is configured with a client secret), DEVICE_KEY.   For REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH/REFRESH_TOKEN: REFRESH_TOKEN (required), SECRET_HASH (required if the app client is configured with a client secret), DEVICE_KEY.   For CUSTOM_AUTH: USERNAME (required), SECRET_HASH (if app client is configured with client secret), DEVICE_KEY. To start the authentication flow with password verification, include ChallengeName: SRP_A and SRP_A: (The SRP_A Value).   For more information about SECRET_HASH, see Computing secret hash values. For information about DEVICE_KEY, see Working with user devices in your user pool.
    ///   - clientId: The ID of the app client where the user wants to sign in.
    ///   - clientMetadata: A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for certain custom workflows that this action triggers. You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminInitiateAuth API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the Lambda functions that are specified for various triggers. The ClientMetadata value is passed as input to the functions for only the following triggers:   Pre signup   Pre authentication   User migration   When Amazon Cognito invokes the functions for these triggers, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a validationData attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminInitiateAuth request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the validationData value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs. When you use the AdminInitiateAuth API action, Amazon Cognito also invokes the functions for the following triggers, but it doesn't provide the ClientMetadata value as input:   Post authentication   Custom message   Pre token generation   Create auth challenge   Define auth challenge   Custom email sender   Custom SMS sender   For more information, see

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - destinationUser: The existing user in the user pool that you want to assign to the external IdP user account. This user can be a local (Username + Password) Amazon Cognito user pools user or a federated user (for example, a SAML or Facebook user). If the user doesn't exist, Amazon Cognito generates an exception. Amazon Cognito returns this user when the new user (with the linked IdP attribute) signs in. For a native username + password user, the ProviderAttributeValue for the DestinationUser should be the username in the user pool. For a federated user, it should be the provider-specific user_id. The ProviderAttributeName of the DestinationUser is ignored. The ProviderName should be set to Cognito for users in Cognito user pools.  All attributes in the DestinationUser profile must be mutable. If you have assigned the user any immutable custom attributes, the operation won't succeed.
    ///   - sourceUser: An external IdP account for a user who doesn't exist yet in the user pool. This user must be a federated user (for example, a SAML or Facebook user), not another native user. If the SourceUser is using a federated social IdP, such as Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon, you must set the ProviderAttributeName to Cognito_Subject. For social IdPs, the ProviderName will be Facebook, Google, or LoginWithAmazon, and Amazon Cognito will automatically parse the Facebook, Google, and Login with Amazon tokens for id, sub, and user_id, respectively. The ProviderAttributeValue for the user must be the same value as the id, sub, or user_id value found in the social IdP token. For OIDC, the ProviderAttributeName can be any mapped value from a claim in the ID token, or that your app retrieves from the userInfo endpoint. For SAML, the ProviderAttributeName can be any mapped value from a claim in the SAML assertion. The following additional considerations apply to SourceUser for OIDC and SAML providers.   You must map the claim to a user pool attribute in your IdP configuration, and set the user pool attribute name as the value of ProviderAttributeName in your AdminLinkProviderForUser request. For example, email.   When you set ProviderAttributeName to Cognito_Subject, Amazon Cognito will automatically parse the default unique identifier found in the subject from the IdP token.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - clientMetadata: A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers. You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the AdminUpdateUserAttributes API action, Amazon Cognito invokes the function that is assigned to the custom message trigger. When Amazon Cognito invokes this function, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your AdminUpdateUserAttributes request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs. For more information, see
    ///   - userAttributes: An array of name-value pairs representing user attributes. For custom attributes, you must prepend the custom: prefix to the attribute name. If your user pool requires verification before Amazon Cognito updates an attribute value that you specify in this request, Amazon Cognito doesn’t immediately update the value of that attribute. After your user receives and responds to a verification message to verify the new value, Amazon Cognito updates the attribute value. Your user can sign in and receive messages with the original attribute value until they verify the new value. To skip the verification message and update the value of an attribute that requires verification in the same API request, include the email_verified or phone_number_verified attribute, with a value of true. If you set the email_verified or phone_number_verified value for an email or phone_number attribute that requires verification to true, Amazon Cognito doesn’t send a verification message to your user.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - accountRecoverySetting: The available verified method a user can use to recover their password when they call ForgotPassword. You can use this setting to define a preferred method when a user has more than one method available. With this setting, SMS doesn't qualify for a valid password recovery mechanism if the user also has SMS multi-factor authentication (MFA) activated. Email MFA is also disqualifying for account recovery with email. In the absence of this setting, Amazon Cognito uses the legacy behavior to determine the recovery method where SMS is preferred over email. As a best practice, configure both verified_email and verified_phone_number, with one having a higher priority than the other.
    ///   - adminCreateUserConfig: The configuration for administrative creation of users. Includes the template for the invitation message for new users, the duration of temporary passwords, and permitting self-service sign-up.
    ///   - aliasAttributes: Attributes supported as an alias for this user pool. For more information about alias attributes, see Customizing sign-in attributes.
    ///   - autoVerifiedAttributes: The attributes that you want your user pool to automatically verify. For more information, see Verifying contact information at sign-up.
    ///   - deletionProtection: When active, DeletionProtection prevents accidental deletion of your user
    ///   - deviceConfiguration: The device-remembering configuration for a user pool. Device remembering or device tracking is a "Remember me on this device" option for user pools that perform authentication with the device key of a trusted device in the back end, instead of a user-provided MFA code. For more information about device authentication, see Working with user devices in your user pool. A null value indicates that you have deactivated device remembering in your user pool.  When you provide a value for any DeviceConfiguration field, you activate the Amazon Cognito device-remembering feature. For more information, see Working with devices.
    ///   - emailConfiguration: The email configuration of your user pool. The email configuration type sets your preferred sending method, Amazon Web Services Region, and sender for messages from your user pool.
    ///   - emailVerificationMessage: This parameter is no longer used.
    ///   - emailVerificationSubject: This parameter is no longer used.
    ///   - lambdaConfig: A collection of user pool Lambda triggers. Amazon Cognito invokes triggers at several possible stages of authentication operations. Triggers can modify the outcome of the operations that invoked them.
    ///   - mfaConfiguration: Sets multi-factor authentication (MFA) to be on, off, or optional. When ON, all users must set up MFA before they can sign in. When OPTIONAL, your application must make a client-side determination of whether a user wants to register an MFA device. For user pools with adaptive authentication with threat protection, choose OPTIONAL. When MfaConfiguration is OPTIONAL, managed login doesn't automatically prompt users to set up MFA. Amazon Cognito generates MFA prompts in API responses and in managed login for users who have chosen and configured a preferred MFA factor.
    ///   - policies: The password policy and sign-in policy in the user pool. The password policy sets options like password complexity requirements and password history. The sign-in policy sets the options available to applications in choice-based authentication.
    ///   - poolName: A friendly name for your user pool.
    ///   - schema: An array of attributes for the new user pool. You can add custom attributes and modify the properties of default attributes. The specifications in this parameter set the required attributes in your user pool. For more information, see Working with user attributes.
    ///   - smsAuthenticationMessage: The contents of the SMS message that your user pool sends to users in SMS OTP and MFA authentication.
    ///   - smsConfiguration: The settings for your Amazon Cognito user pool to send SMS messages with Amazon Simple Notification Service. To send SMS messages with Amazon SNS in the Amazon Web Services Region that you want, the Amazon Cognito user pool uses an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role in your Amazon Web Services account. For more information see SMS message settings.
    ///   - smsVerificationMessage: This parameter is no longer used.
    ///   - userAttributeUpdateSettings: The settings for updates to user attributes. These settings include the property AttributesRequireVerificationBeforeUpdate,
    ///   - usernameAttributes: Specifies whether a user can use an email address or phone number as a username when they sign up. For more information, see Customizing sign-in attributes.
    ///   - usernameConfiguration: Sets the case sensitivity option for sign-in usernames. When CaseSensitive is false (case insensitive), users can sign in with any combination of capital and lowercase letters. For example, username, USERNAME, or UserName, or for email, email@example.com or EMaiL@eXamplE.Com. For most use cases, set case sensitivity to false as a best practice. When usernames and email addresses are case insensitive, Amazon Cognito treats any variation in case as the same user, and prevents a case variation from being assigned to the same attribute for a different user. When CaseSensitive is true (case sensitive), Amazon Cognito interprets USERNAME and UserName as distinct users. This configuration is immutable after you set it.
    ///   - userPoolAddOns: Contains settings for activation of threat protection, including the operating
    ///   - userPoolTags: The tag keys and values to assign to the user pool. A tag is a label that you can use to categorize and manage user pools in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.
    ///   - userPoolTier: The user pool feature plan, or tier. This parameter determines the eligibility of the user pool for features like managed login, access-token customization, and threat protection. Defaults to ESSENTIALS.
    ///   - verificationMessageTemplate: The template for the verification message that your user pool delivers to users who set an email address or phone number attribute. Set the email message type that corresponds to your DefaultEmailOption selection. For CONFIRM_WITH_LINK, specify an EmailMessageByLink and leave EmailMessage blank. For CONFIRM_WITH_CODE, specify an EmailMessage and leave EmailMessageByLink blank. When you supply both parameters with either choice, Amazon Cognito returns an error.

To create an app client that generates client credentials grants, you must add client_credentials as the only allowed OAuth flow.  code  Use a code grant flow, which provides an authorization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for access tokens with the /oauth2/token endpoint.  implicit  Issue the access token, and the ID token when scopes like openid and profile are requested, directly to your user.  client_credentials  Issue the access token from the /oauth2/token endpoint directly to a non-person user, authorized by a combination of the client ID and client secret.
    ///   - allowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient: Set to true to use OAuth 2.0 authorization server features in your app client. This parameter must have a value of true before you can configure
    ///   - allowedOAuthScopes: The OAuth, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and custom scopes that you want to permit your app client to authorize access with. Scopes govern access control to user pool self-service API operations, user data from the userInfo endpoint, and third-party APIs. Scope values include phone, email, openid, and profile. The aws.cognito.signin.user.admin scope authorizes user self-service operations. Custom scopes with resource servers authorize access to external APIs.
    ///   - analyticsConfiguration: The user pool analytics configuration for collecting metrics and sending them to your Amazon Pinpoint campaign. In Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon Pinpoint isn't available, user pools might not have access to analytics or might be configurable with campaigns in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. For more information, see Using Amazon Pinpoint analytics.
    ///   - authSessionValidity: Amazon Cognito creates a session token for each API request in an authentication flow. AuthSessionValidity is the duration,
    ///   - callbackURLs: A list of allowed redirect, or callback, URLs for managed login authentication. These URLs are the paths where you want to send your users' browsers after they complete authentication with managed login or a third-party IdP. Typically, callback URLs are the home of an application that uses OAuth or OIDC libraries to process authentication outcomes. A redirect URI must meet the following requirements:   Be an absolute URI.   Be registered with the authorization server. Amazon Cognito doesn't accept authorization requests with redirect_uri values that aren't in the list of CallbackURLs that you provide in this parameter.   Not include a fragment component.   See OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint. Amazon Cognito requires HTTPS over HTTP except for http://localhost for testing purposes only. App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.
    ///   - clientName: A friendly name for the app client that you want to create.
    ///   - defaultRedirectURI: The default redirect URI. In app clients with one assigned IdP, replaces redirect_uri in authentication requests. Must be in the CallbackURLs list.
    ///   - enablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData: When true, your application can include additional UserContextData in authentication requests. This data includes the IP address, and contributes to analysis by threat protection features. For more information about propagation of user context data, see Adding session data to API requests. If you don’t include this parameter, you can't send the source IP address to Amazon Cognito threat protection features. You can only activate EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData in an app client that has a client secret.
    ///   - enableTokenRevocation: Activates or deactivates token revocation in the target app client. If you don't include this parameter, token revocation is automatically activated for the new user pool client.
    ///   - explicitAuthFlows: The authentication flows that you want your user pool client to support. For each app
    ///   - generateSecret: When true, generates a client secret for the app client. Client secrets are used with server-side and machine-to-machine applications. Client secrets are automatically generated; you can't specify a secret value. For more information, see App client types.
    ///   - idTokenValidity: The ID token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use
    ///   - logoutURLs: A list of allowed logout URLs for managed login authentication. When you pass logout_uri and client_id parameters to /logout, Amazon Cognito signs out your user and redirects them to the logout URL. This parameter describes the URLs that you want to be the permitted targets of logout_uri. A typical use of these URLs is when a user selects "Sign out" and you redirect them to your public homepage. For more information, see Logout endpoint.
    ///   - preventUserExistenceErrors: When ENABLED, suppresses messages that might indicate a valid user exists  when someone attempts sign-in. This parameters sets your preference for the errors and  responses that you want Amazon Cognito APIs to return during authentication, account confirmation, and password recovery when the user doesn't exist in the user pool. When set to ENABLED and the user doesn't exist, authentication returns an error indicating either the username or password was incorrect. Account confirmation and password recovery return a response indicating a code was sent to a simulated destination. When set to LEGACY, those APIs return a UserNotFoundException exception if the user doesn't exist in the user pool. Defaults to LEGACY.
    ///   - readAttributes: The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have read access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to read their own attribute value for any attribute in this list. When you don't specify the ReadAttributes for your app client, your app can read the values of email_verified, phone_number_verified, and the standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool app client has read access to these default attributes, ReadAttributes doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates ReadAttributes in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of read attributes.

    ///   - supportedIdentityProviders: A list of provider names for the identity providers (IdPs) that are supported on this client. The following are supported: COGNITO, Facebook, Google, SignInWithApple, and LoginWithAmazon. You can also specify the names that you configured for the SAML and OIDC IdPs in your user pool, for example MySAMLIdP or MyOIDCIdP. This parameter sets the IdPs that managed  login will display on the login page for your app client. The removal of  COGNITO from this list doesn't prevent authentication operations  for local users with the user pools API in an Amazon Web Services SDK. The only way to prevent  SDK-based authentication is to block access with a WAF rule.
    ///   - tokenValidityUnits: The units that validity times are represented in. The default unit for refresh tokens is days, and the default for ID and access tokens are hours.
    ///   - userPoolId: The ID of the user pool where you want to create an app client.
    ///   - writeAttributes: The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have write access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to set or modify their own attribute value for any attribute in this list. When you don't specify the WriteAttributes for your app client, your app can write the values of the Standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool has write access to these default attributes, WriteAttributes doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates WriteAttributes in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of write attributes. If your app client allows users to sign in through an IdP, this array must include all attributes that you have mapped to IdP attributes. Amazon Cognito updates mapped attributes when users sign in to your application through an IdP. If your app client does not have write access to a mapped attribute, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it tries to update the attribute.

    ///   - authFlow: The authentication flow that you want to initiate. Each AuthFlow has linked AuthParameters that you must submit. The following are some example flows.  USER_AUTH  The entry point for choice-based authentication with passwords, one-time passwords, and WebAuthn authenticators. Request a preferred authentication type or review available authentication types. From the offered authentication types, select one in a challenge response and then authenticate with that method in an additional challenge response. To activate this setting, your user pool must be in the  Essentials tier or higher.  USER_SRP_AUTH  Username-password authentication with the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol. For more information, see Use SRP password verification in custom authentication flow.  REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH and REFRESH_TOKEN  Receive new ID and access tokens when you pass a REFRESH_TOKEN parameter with a valid refresh token as the value. For more information, see Using the refresh token.  CUSTOM_AUTH  Custom authentication with Lambda triggers. For more information, see Custom authentication challenge Lambda triggers.  USER_PASSWORD_AUTH  Client-side username-password authentication with the password sent directly in the request. For more information about client-side and server-side authentication, see SDK authorization models.    ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH is a flow type of AdminInitiateAuth and isn't valid for InitiateAuth. ADMIN_NO_SRP_AUTH is a legacy server-side username-password flow and isn't valid for InitiateAuth.

You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you send an InitiateAuth request, Amazon Cognito invokes the Lambda functions that are specified for various triggers. The ClientMetadata value is passed as input to the functions for only the following triggers.   Pre sign-up   Pre authentication   User migration   When Amazon Cognito invokes the functions for these triggers, it passes a JSON payload as input to the function. This payload contains a validationData attribute with the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your InitiateAuth request.

When you don't provide an AttributesToGet parameter, Amazon Cognito returns all attributes for each user. Use AttributesToGet with required attributes in your user pool, or in conjunction with Filter. Amazon Cognito returns an error if not all users in the results have set a value for the attribute you request. Attributes that you can't filter on, including custom attributes, must have a value set in every user profile before an AttributesToGet parameter returns results.
    ///   - filter: A filter string of the form "AttributeName Filter-Type "AttributeValue". Quotation marks within the filter string must be escaped using the backslash (\) character. For example, "family_name = \"Reddy\"".    AttributeName: The name of the attribute to search for. You can only search for one attribute at a time.    Filter-Type: For an exact match, use =, for example, "given_name = \"Jon\"". For a prefix ("starts with") match, use ^=, for example, "given_name ^= \"Jon\"".     AttributeValue: The attribute value that must be matched for each user.   If the filter string is empty, ListUsers returns all users in the user pool. You can only search for the following standard attributes:    username (case-sensitive)    email     phone_number     name     given_name     family_name     preferred_username     cognito:user_status (called Status in the Console) (case-insensitive)    status (called Enabled in the Console) (case-sensitive)     sub    Custom attributes aren't searchable.  You can also list users with a client-side filter. The server-side filter matches no more than one attribute. For an advanced search, use a client-side filter with the --query parameter of the list-users action in the CLI. When you use a client-side filter, ListUsers returns a paginated list of zero or more users. You can receive multiple pages in a row with zero results. Repeat the query with each pagination token that is returned until you receive a null pagination token value, and then review the combined result.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - analyticsMetadata: Information that supports analytics outcomes with Amazon Pinpoint, including the
    ///   - clientId: The ID of the app client where the user wants to sign up.
    ///   - clientMetadata: A map of custom key-value pairs that you can provide as input for any custom workflows that this action triggers. You create custom workflows by assigning Lambda functions to user pool triggers. When you use the SignUp API action, Amazon Cognito invokes any functions that are assigned to the following triggers: pre sign-up, custom message, and post confirmation. When Amazon Cognito invokes any of these functions, it passes a JSON payload, which the function receives as input. This payload contains a clientMetadata attribute, which provides the data that you assigned to the ClientMetadata parameter in your SignUp request. In your function code in Lambda, you can process the clientMetadata value to enhance your workflow for your specific needs. For more information, see
    ///   - password: The user's proposed password. The password must comply with the password requirements of your user pool. Users can sign up without a password when your user pool supports passwordless sign-in with email or SMS OTPs. To create a user with no password, omit this parameter or submit a blank value. You can only create a passwordless user when passwordless sign-in is available.
    ///   - secretHash: A keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC) calculated using the secret key of a user pool client and username plus the client ID in the message. For more information about SecretHash, see Computing secret hash values.
    ///   - userAttributes: An array of name-value pairs representing user attributes. For custom attributes, include a custom: prefix in the attribute name, for example custom:department.
    ///   - userContextData: Contextual data about your user session like the device fingerprint, IP address, or location. Amazon Cognito threat
    ///   - username: The username of the user that you want to sign up. The value of this parameter is typically a username, but can be any alias attribute in your user pool.
    ///   - validationData: Temporary user attributes that contribute to the outcomes of your pre sign-up Lambda trigger. This set of key-value pairs are for custom validation of information that you  collect from your users but don't need to retain. Your Lambda function can analyze this additional data and act on it. Your function can automatically confirm and verify select users or perform external API operations  like logging user attributes and validation data to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

When OPTIONAL, your application must make a client-side determination of whether a user wants to register an MFA device. For user pools with adaptive authentication with threat protection, choose OPTIONAL. When MfaConfiguration is OPTIONAL, managed login doesn't automatically prompt users to set up MFA. Amazon Cognito generates MFA prompts in API responses and in managed login for users who have chosen and configured a preferred MFA factor.

To create an app client that generates client credentials grants, you must add client_credentials as the only allowed OAuth flow.  code  Use a code grant flow, which provides an authorization code as the response. This code can be exchanged for access tokens with the /oauth2/token endpoint.  implicit  Issue the access token (and, optionally, ID token, based on scopes) directly to your user.  client_credentials  Issue the access token from the /oauth2/token endpoint directly to a non-person user using a combination of the client ID and client secret.
    ///   - allowedOAuthFlowsUserPoolClient: Set to true to use OAuth 2.0 authorization server features in your app client. This parameter must have a value of true before you can configure
    ///   - allowedOAuthScopes: The OAuth, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and custom scopes that you want to permit your app client to authorize access with. Scopes govern access control to user pool self-service API operations, user data from the userInfo endpoint, and third-party APIs. Scope values include phone, email, openid, and profile. The aws.cognito.signin.user.admin scope authorizes user self-service operations. Custom scopes with resource servers authorize access to external APIs.
    ///   - analyticsConfiguration: The user pool analytics configuration for collecting metrics and sending them to your Amazon Pinpoint campaign. In Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon Pinpoint isn't available, user pools might not have access to analytics or might be configurable with campaigns in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. For more information, see Using Amazon Pinpoint analytics.
    ///   - authSessionValidity: Amazon Cognito creates a session token for each API request in an authentication flow. AuthSessionValidity is the duration,
    ///   - callbackURLs: A list of allowed redirect, or callback, URLs for managed login authentication. These URLs are the paths where you want to send your users' browsers after they complete authentication with managed login or a third-party IdP. Typically, callback URLs are the home of an application that uses OAuth or OIDC libraries to process authentication outcomes. A redirect URI must meet the following requirements:   Be an absolute URI.   Be registered with the authorization server. Amazon Cognito doesn't accept authorization requests with redirect_uri values that aren't in the list of CallbackURLs that you provide in this parameter.   Not include a fragment component.   See OAuth 2.0 - Redirection Endpoint. Amazon Cognito requires HTTPS over HTTP except for http://localhost for testing purposes only. App callback URLs such as myapp://example are also supported.
    ///   - clientId: The ID of the app client that you want to update.
    ///   - clientName: A friendly name for the app client.
    ///   - defaultRedirectURI: The default redirect URI. In app clients with one assigned IdP, replaces redirect_uri in authentication requests. Must be in the CallbackURLs list.
    ///   - enablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData: When true, your application can include additional UserContextData in authentication requests. This data includes the IP address, and contributes to analysis by threat protection features. For more information about propagation of user context data, see Adding session data to API requests. If you don’t include this parameter, you can't send the source IP address to Amazon Cognito threat protection features. You can only activate EnablePropagateAdditionalUserContextData in an app client that has a client secret.
    ///   - enableTokenRevocation: Activates or deactivates token revocation in the target app client.
    ///   - explicitAuthFlows: The authentication flows that you want your user pool client to support. For each app
    ///   - idTokenValidity: The ID token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use
    ///   - logoutURLs: A list of allowed logout URLs for managed login authentication. When you pass logout_uri and client_id parameters to /logout, Amazon Cognito signs out your user and redirects them to the logout URL. This parameter describes the URLs that you want to be the permitted targets of logout_uri. A typical use of these URLs is when a user selects "Sign out" and you redirect them to your public homepage. For more information, see Logout endpoint.
    ///   - preventUserExistenceErrors: When ENABLED, suppresses messages that might indicate a valid user exists  when someone attempts sign-in. This parameters sets your preference for the errors and  responses that you want Amazon Cognito APIs to return during authentication, account confirmation, and password recovery when the user doesn't exist in the user pool. When set to ENABLED and the user doesn't exist, authentication returns an error indicating either the username or password was incorrect. Account confirmation and password recovery return a response indicating a code was sent to a simulated destination. When set to LEGACY, those APIs return a UserNotFoundException exception if the user doesn't exist in the user pool. Defaults to LEGACY.
    ///   - readAttributes: The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have read access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to read their own attribute value for any attribute in this list. When you don't specify the ReadAttributes for your app client, your app can read the values of email_verified, phone_number_verified, and the standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool app client has read access to these default attributes, ReadAttributes doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates ReadAttributes in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of read attributes.
    ///   - refreshTokenValidity: The refresh token time limit. After this limit expires, your user can't use
    ///   - supportedIdentityProviders: A list of provider names for the identity providers (IdPs) that are supported on this client. The following are supported: COGNITO, Facebook, Google, SignInWithApple, and LoginWithAmazon. You can also specify the names that you configured for the SAML and OIDC IdPs in your user pool, for example MySAMLIdP or MyOIDCIdP. This parameter sets the IdPs that managed  login will display on the login page for your app client. The removal of  COGNITO from this list doesn't prevent authentication operations  for local users with the user pools API in an Amazon Web Services SDK. The only way to prevent  SDK-based authentication is to block access with a WAF rule.
    ///   - tokenValidityUnits: The units that validity times are represented in. The default unit for refresh tokens is days, and the default for ID and access tokens are hours.
    ///   - userPoolId: The ID of the user pool where you want to update the app client.
    ///   - writeAttributes: The list of user attributes that you want your app client to have write access to. After your user authenticates in your app, their access token authorizes them to set or modify their own attribute value for any attribute in this list. When you don't specify the WriteAttributes for your app client, your app can write the values of the Standard attributes of your user pool. When your user pool has write access to these default attributes, WriteAttributes doesn't return any information. Amazon Cognito only populates WriteAttributes in the API response if you have specified your own custom set of write attributes. If your app client allows users to sign in through an IdP, this array must include all attributes that you have mapped to IdP attributes. Amazon Cognito updates mapped attributes when users sign in to your application through an IdP. If your app client does not have write access to a mapped attribute, Amazon Cognito throws an error when it tries to update the attribute. For more information, see Specifying IdP Attribute Mappings for Your user pool.

When you don't provide an AttributesToGet parameter, Amazon Cognito returns all attributes for each user. Use AttributesToGet with required attributes in your user pool, or in conjunction with Filter. Amazon Cognito returns an error if not all users in the results have set a value for the attribute you request. Attributes that you can't filter on, including custom attributes, must have a value set in every user profile before an AttributesToGet parameter returns results.
    ///   - filter: A filter string of the form "AttributeName Filter-Type "AttributeValue". Quotation marks within the filter string must be escaped using the backslash (\) character. For example, "family_name = \"Reddy\"".    AttributeName: The name of the attribute to search for. You can only search for one attribute at a time.    Filter-Type: For an exact match, use =, for example, "given_name = \"Jon\"". For a prefix ("starts with") match, use ^=, for example, "given_name ^= \"Jon\"".     AttributeValue: The attribute value that must be matched for each user.   If the filter string is empty, ListUsers returns all users in the user pool. You can only search for the following standard attributes:    username (case-sensitive)    email     phone_number     name     given_name     family_name     preferred_username     cognito:user_status (called Status in the Console) (case-insensitive)    status (called Enabled in the Console) (case-sensitive)     sub    Custom attributes aren't searchable.  You can also list users with a client-side filter. The server-side filter matches no more than one attribute. For an advanced search, use a client-side filter with the --query parameter of the list-users action in the CLI. When you use a client-side filter, ListUsers returns a paginated list of zero or more users. You can receive multiple pages in a row with zero results. Repeat the query with each pagination token that is returned until you receive a null pagination token value, and then review the combined result.  For more information about server-side and client-side filtering, see FilteringCLI output in the Command Line Interface User Guide.   For more information, see Searching for Users Using the ListUsers API and Examples of Using the ListUsers API in the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide.
