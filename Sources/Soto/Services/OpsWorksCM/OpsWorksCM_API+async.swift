    // MARK: Async API Calls

    ///  Associates a new node with the server. For more information about how to disassociate a node, see DisassociateNode.  On a Chef server: This command is an alternative to knife bootstrap.  Example (Chef): aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name MyServer --node-name MyManagedNode --engine-attributes "Name=CHEF_ORGANIZATION,Value=default" "Name=CHEF_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY,Value=public-key-pem"   On a Puppet server, this command is an alternative to the puppet cert sign command that signs a Puppet node CSR.   Example (Puppet): aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name MyServer --node-name MyManagedNode --engine-attributes "Name=PUPPET_NODE_CSR,Value=csr-pem"   A node can can only be associated with servers that are in a HEALTHY state. Otherwise, an InvalidStateException is thrown. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server does not exist. A ValidationException is raised when parameters of the request are not valid. The AssociateNode API call can be integrated into Auto Scaling configurations, AWS Cloudformation templates, or the user data of a server's instance.

    ///  Creates an application-level backup of a server. While the server is in the BACKING_UP state, the server cannot be changed, and no additional backup can be created.   Backups can be created for servers in RUNNING, HEALTHY, and UNHEALTHY states. By default, you can create a maximum of 50 manual backups.   This operation is asynchronous.   A LimitExceededException is thrown when the maximum number of manual backups is reached. An InvalidStateException is thrown when the server is not in any of the following states: RUNNING, HEALTHY, or UNHEALTHY. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server is not found. A ValidationException is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.
    public func createBackup(_ input: CreateBackupRequest, logger: Logger = AWSClient.loggingDisabled, on eventLoop: EventLoop? = nil) async throws -> CreateBackupResponse {

    ///  Creates and immedately starts a new server. The server is ready to use when it is in the HEALTHY state. By default, you can create a maximum of 10 servers.   This operation is asynchronous.   A LimitExceededException is thrown when you have created the maximum number of servers (10). A ResourceAlreadyExistsException is thrown when a server with the same name already exists in the account. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when you specify a backup ID that is not valid or is for a backup that does not exist. A ValidationException is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.   If you do not specify a security group by adding the SecurityGroupIds parameter, AWS OpsWorks creates a new security group.   Chef Automate: The default security group opens the Chef server to the world on TCP port 443. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22.   Puppet Enterprise: The default security group opens TCP ports 22, 443, 4433, 8140, 8142, 8143, and 8170. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22.  By default, your server is accessible from any IP address. We recommend that you update your security group rules to allow access from known IP addresses and address ranges only. To edit security group rules, open Security Groups in the navigation pane of the EC2 management console.  To specify your own domain for a server, and provide your own self-signed or CA-signed certificate and private key, specify values for CustomDomain, CustomCertificate, and CustomPrivateKey.
