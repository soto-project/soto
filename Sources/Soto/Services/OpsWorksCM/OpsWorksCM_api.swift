/// Service object for interacting with AWS OpsWorksCM service.

/// AWS OpsWorks CM AWS OpsWorks for configuration management (CM) is a service that runs and manages configuration management servers. You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise servers, and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage.  Glossary of terms     Server: A configuration management server that can be  highly-available. The configuration management server runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.    Engine: The engine is the specific configuration manager  that you want to use. Valid values in this release include ChefAutomate and Puppet.    Backup: This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup starts.    Events: Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.    Account attributes: Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account.     Endpoints  AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.   opsworks-cm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.us-east-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.us-west-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.us-west-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com   For more information, see AWS OpsWorks endpoints and quotas in the AWS General Reference.  Throttling limits  All API operations allow for five requests per second with a burst of 10 requests per second.

    // MARK: API Calls

    ///  Associates a new node with the server. For more information about how to disassociate a node, see DisassociateNode.  On a Chef server: This command is an alternative to  knife bootstrap.  Example (Chef): aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name MyServer --node-name MyManagedNode --engine-attributes "Name=CHEF_ORGANIZATION,Value=default" "Name=CHEF_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY,Value=public-key-pem"   On a Puppet server, this command is an alternative to the puppet cert sign command that signs a Puppet node CSR.   Example (Puppet): aws opsworks-cm associate-node --server-name MyServer --node-name MyManagedNode --engine-attributes "Name=PUPPET_NODE_CSR,Value=csr-pem"   A node can can only be associated with servers that are in a HEALTHY state. Otherwise, an InvalidStateException is thrown. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server does not exist. A ValidationException is raised when parameters of the request are not valid. The AssociateNode API call can be integrated into Auto Scaling configurations, AWS Cloudformation templates, or the user data of a server's instance.

Backups can be created for servers in RUNNING, HEALTHY, and UNHEALTHY states. By default, you can create a maximum of 50 manual backups.   This operation is asynchronous.   A LimitExceededException is thrown when the maximum number of manual backups is reached. An InvalidStateException is thrown when the server is not in any of the following states: RUNNING, HEALTHY, or UNHEALTHY. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server is not found. A ValidationException is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.

This operation is asynchronous.   A LimitExceededException is thrown when you have created the maximum number of servers (10). A ResourceAlreadyExistsException is thrown when a server with the same name already exists in the account. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when you specify a backup ID that is not valid or is for a backup that does not exist. A ValidationException is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.   If you do not specify a security group by adding the SecurityGroupIds parameter, AWS OpsWorks creates a new security group.   Chef Automate: The default security group opens the Chef server to the world on TCP port 443. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22.   Puppet Enterprise: The default security group opens TCP ports 22, 443, 4433, 8140, 8142, 8143, and 8170. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks enables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22.  By default, your server is accessible from any IP address. We recommend that you update your security group rules to allow access from known IP addresses and address ranges only. To edit security group rules, open Security Groups in the navigation pane of the EC2 management console.  To specify your own domain for a server, and provide your own self-signed or CA-signed certificate and private key, specify values for CustomDomain,  CustomCertificate, and CustomPrivateKey.
