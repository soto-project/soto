Amazon Location uses the data when it reports the last known device  position and position history. Amazon Location retains location data for 30 days.  Position updates are handled based on the PositionFiltering  property of the tracker. When PositionFiltering is set to  TimeBased, updates are evaluated against linked geofence collections,  and location data is stored at a maximum of one position per 30 second interval.  If your update frequency is more often than every 30 seconds, only one update per  30 seconds is stored for each unique device ID. When PositionFiltering is set to DistanceBased  filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence  collections only if the device has moved more than 30 m (98.4 ft). When PositionFiltering is set to AccuracyBased  filtering, location data is stored and evaluated against linked geofence  collections only if the device has moved more than the measured accuracy. For  example, if two consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of  5 m and 10 m, the second update is neither stored or evaluated if the device has  moved less than 15 m. If PositionFiltering is set to  AccuracyBased filtering, Amazon Location uses the default value  { "Horizontal": 0} when accuracy is not provided on a DevicePositionUpdate.
