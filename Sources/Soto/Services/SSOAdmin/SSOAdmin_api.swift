/// Service object for interacting with AWS SSOAdmin service.

/// IAM Identity Center (successor to Single Sign-On) helps you securely create, or connect, your workforce identities and manage their access centrally across Amazon Web Services accounts and applications. IAM Identity Center is the recommended approach for workforce authentication and authorization in Amazon Web Services, for organizations of any size and type.  IAM Identity Center uses the sso and identitystore API namespaces.  This reference guide provides information on single sign-on operations which could be used for access management of Amazon Web Services accounts. For information about IAM Identity Center features, see the IAM Identity Center User Guide. Many operations in the IAM Identity Center APIs rely on identifiers for users and groups, known as principals. For more information about how to work with principals and principal IDs in IAM Identity Center, see the Identity Store API Reference.  Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, and more). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to IAM Identity Center and other Amazon Web Services services. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.
