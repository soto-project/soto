/// Service object for interacting with AWS Route53RecoveryCluster service.
///
/// Welcome to the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.
/// 			      With Route 53 ARC, you can use routing control with extreme reliability to
/// 			recover applications by rerouting traffic across
/// 			Availability Zones or Amazon Web Services Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted
/// 			on a highly available cluster in Route 53 ARC. A cluster provides a set of five redundant Regional endpoints against which you
/// 			can run API calls to get or update the state of routing controls. To implement failover, you set
/// 			one routing control On and another one Off, to reroute traffic from one Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region
/// 			to another.
/// 			       Be aware that you must specify a Regional endpoint for a cluster when you work with API cluster operations
/// 				to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC. In addition, you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region
/// 				for Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the parameter --region us-west-2 with AWS CLI commands.
/// 				For more information, see
///
/// 					Get and update routing control states using the API in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
/// 		       This API guide includes information about the API operations for how to get and update routing control states
/// 			in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing control in Route 53 ARC, you must first create the required components (clusters, control
/// 			panels, and routing controls) using the recovery cluster configuration API.
/// 			      For more information about working with routing control in Route 53 ARC, see the following:
///
/// 				           Create clusters, control panels, and routing controls by using API operations. For more information,
/// 					see the Recovery Control Configuration API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.
/// 			           Learn about the components in recovery control, including clusters,
/// 				routing controls, and control panels, and how to work with Route 53 ARC in the Amazon Web Services console. For more
/// 				information, see
/// 					Recovery control components in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
/// 				           Route 53 ARC also provides readiness checks that continually audit resources to help make sure that your
/// 					applications are scaled and ready to handle failover traffic. For more information about
/// 					the related API operations, see the Recovery Readiness API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.
///
/// 				           For more information about creating resilient applications and preparing for
/// 					recovery readiness with Route 53 ARC, see the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.
