/// Service object for interacting with AWS ARCZonalShift service.
///
/// Welcome to the Zonal Shift API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller (Route 53 ARC). You can start a zonal shift to move traffic for a load balancer resource away from an Availability Zone to
/// 			help your application recover quickly from an impairment in an Availability Zone. For example,
/// 			you can recover your application from a developer's bad code deployment or from an
/// 			Amazon Web Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone. You can also configure zonal autoshift for a load balancer resource. Zonal autoshift
/// 			is a capability in Route 53 ARC where Amazon Web Services shifts away application resource
/// 			traffic from an Availability Zone, on your behalf, to help reduce your time to recovery during events.
/// 			Amazon Web Services shifts away traffic for resources that are enabled for zonal autoshift whenever Amazon Web Services
/// 			determines that there's an issue in the Availability Zone that could potentially affect
/// 			customers. To ensure that zonal autoshift is safe for your application, you must
/// 			also configure practice runs when you enable zonal autoshift for a resource. Practice runs start
/// 			weekly zonal shifts for a resource, to shift
/// 			traffic for the resource out of an Availability Zone. Practice runs make sure, on a regular basis,
/// 			that you have enough capacity in all the Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services Region
/// 			for your application to continue to operate normally
/// 			when traffic for a resource is shifted away from one Availability Zone.  You must prescale resource capacity in all Availability Zones in the Region
/// 			where your application is deployed, before you configure practice runs or enable zonal autoshift
/// 			for a resource. You should not rely on scaling on demand when an autoshift or practice run
/// 			starts.   For more information about using zonal shift and zonal autoshift, see the
/// 			Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller
/// 				Developer Guide.
