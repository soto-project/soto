/// Service object for interacting with AWS ARCZonalShift service.
///
/// Welcome to the API Reference Guide for zonal shift and zonal autoshift in Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC). You can start a zonal shift to move traffic for a load balancer resource away from an Availability Zone to help your application recover quickly from an impairment in an Availability Zone. For example, you can recover your application from a developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone. You can also configure zonal autoshift for supported load balancer resources. Zonal autoshift is a capability in ARC where you authorize Amazon Web Services to shift away application resource traffic from an Availability Zone during events, on your behalf, to help reduce your time to recovery. Amazon Web Services starts an autoshift when internal telemetry indicates that there is an Availability Zone impairment that could potentially impact customers. For more information about using zonal shift and zonal autoshift, see the Amazon Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.

    ///   - blockedDates: Optionally, you can block ARC from starting practice runs for a resource on specific calendar dates. The format for blocked dates is: YYYY-MM-DD. Keep in mind, when you specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs are in UTC. Separate multiple blocked dates with spaces. For example, if you have an application update scheduled to launch on May 1, 2024, and you don't want practice runs to shift traffic away at that time, you could set a blocked date for 2024-05-01.
    ///   - blockedWindows: Optionally, you can block ARC from starting practice runs for specific windows of days and times.  The format for blocked windows is: DAY:HH:SS-DAY:HH:SS. Keep in mind, when you specify dates, that dates and times for practice runs are in UTC. Also, be aware of potential time adjustments that might be required for daylight saving time differences. Separate multiple blocked windows with spaces. For example, say you run business report summaries three days a week. For this scenario, you might set the following recurring days and times as blocked windows, for example: MON-20:30-21:30 WED-20:30-21:30 FRI-20:30-21:30.
    ///   - blockingAlarms: An Amazon CloudWatch alarm that you can specify for zonal autoshift practice runs. This alarm blocks ARC from starting practice run zonal shifts, and ends a practice run that's in progress, when the alarm is in an ALARM state.
    ///   - outcomeAlarms: The outcome alarm for practice runs is a required Amazon CloudWatch alarm that you specify that ends a practice run when the alarm is in an ALARM state. Configure the alarm to monitor the health of your application when traffic is shifted away from an Availability Zone during each practice run. You should configure the alarm to go into an ALARM state if your application is impacted by the zonal shift, and you want to stop the zonal shift, to let traffic for the resource return to the Availability Zone.

You can set a zonal shift to be active initially for up to three days (72 hours).
