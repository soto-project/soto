    /// Parameters:
    ///   - acceptLanguage: The language code.    jp - Japanese    zh - Chinese
    ///   - portfolioId: The portfolio identifier.
    ///   - principalARN: The ARN of the principal (user, role, or group). If the PrincipalType is IAM, the supported value is a  fully defined  IAM Amazon Resource Name (ARN).  If the PrincipalType is IAM_PATTERN,  the supported value is an IAM ARN without an AccountID in the following format:  arn:partition:iam:::resource-type/resource-id  The ARN resource-id can be either:   A fully formed resource-id. For example, arn:aws:iam:::role/resource-name or  arn:aws:iam:::role/resource-path/resource-name    A wildcard ARN. The wildcard ARN accepts IAM_PATTERN values with a  "*" or "?" in the resource-id segment of the ARN. For example arn:partition:service:::resource-type/resource-path/resource-name.  The new symbols are exclusive to the resource-path and resource-name  and cannot replace the resource-type or other  ARN values.  The ARN path and principal name allow unlimited wildcard characters.   Examples of an acceptable wildcard ARN:   arn:aws:iam:::role/ResourceName_*   arn:aws:iam:::role/*/ResourceName_?   Examples of an unacceptable wildcard ARN:   arn:aws:iam:::*/ResourceName   You can associate multiple IAM_PATTERNs even if the account has no principal  with that name.  The "?" wildcard character matches zero or one of any character. This is similar to ".?" in regular  regex context. The "*" wildcard character matches any number of any characters.  This is similar to ".*" in regular regex context. In the IAM Principal ARN format (arn:partition:iam:::resource-type/resource-path/resource-name),  valid resource-type values include user/, group/,  or role/.  The "?" and "*" characters are allowed only after the resource-type in the resource-id segment.  You can use special characters anywhere within the resource-id.  The "*" character also matches the "/" character, allowing paths to be formed within the  resource-id. For example, arn:aws:iam:::role/*/ResourceName_?  matches both arn:aws:iam:::role/pathA/pathB/ResourceName_1  and  arn:aws:iam:::role/pathA/ResourceName_1.

    ///   - parameters: The constraint parameters, in JSON format. The syntax depends on the constraint type as follows:  LAUNCH  You are required to specify either the RoleArn or the LocalRoleName but can't use both. Specify the RoleArn property as follows:  {"RoleArn" : "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/LaunchRole"}  Specify the LocalRoleName property as follows:  {"LocalRoleName": "SCBasicLaunchRole"}  If you specify the LocalRoleName property, when an account uses the launch constraint, the IAM role with that name in the account will be used. This allows launch-role constraints to be  account-agnostic so the administrator can create fewer resources per shared account.  The given role name must exist in the account used to create the launch constraint and the account of the user who launches a product with this launch constraint.  You cannot have both a LAUNCH and a STACKSET constraint. You also cannot have more than one LAUNCH constraint on a product and portfolio.  NOTIFICATION  Specify the NotificationArns property as follows:  {"NotificationArns" : ["arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:Topic"]}   RESOURCE_UPDATE  Specify the TagUpdatesOnProvisionedProduct property as follows:  {"Version":"2.0","Properties":{"TagUpdateOnProvisionedProduct":"String"}}  The TagUpdatesOnProvisionedProduct property accepts a string value of ALLOWED or NOT_ALLOWED.  STACKSET  Specify the Parameters property as follows:  {"Version": "String", "Properties": {"AccountList": [ "String" ], "RegionList": [ "String" ], "AdminRole": "String", "ExecutionRole": "String"}}  You cannot have both a LAUNCH and a STACKSET constraint. You also cannot have more than one STACKSET constraint on a product and portfolio. Products with a STACKSET constraint will launch an CloudFormation stack set.  TEMPLATE  Specify the Rules property. For more information, see Template Constraint Rules.

The syntax depends on the constraint type as follows:  LAUNCH  You are required to specify either the RoleArn or the LocalRoleName but can't use both. Specify the RoleArn property as follows:  {"RoleArn" : "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/LaunchRole"}  Specify the LocalRoleName property as follows:  {"LocalRoleName": "SCBasicLaunchRole"}  If you specify the LocalRoleName property, when an account uses the launch constraint, the IAM role with that name in the account will be used. This allows launch-role constraints to be  account-agnostic so the administrator can create fewer resources per shared account.  The given role name must exist in the account used to create the launch constraint and the account of the user who launches a product with this launch constraint.  You cannot have both a LAUNCH and a STACKSET constraint. You also cannot have more than one LAUNCH constraint on a product and portfolio.  NOTIFICATION  Specify the NotificationArns property as follows:  {"NotificationArns" : ["arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:Topic"]}   RESOURCE_UPDATE  Specify the TagUpdatesOnProvisionedProduct property as follows:  {"Version":"2.0","Properties":{"TagUpdateOnProvisionedProduct":"String"}}  The TagUpdatesOnProvisionedProduct property accepts a string value of ALLOWED or NOT_ALLOWED.  STACKSET  Specify the Parameters property as follows:  {"Version": "String", "Properties": {"AccountList": [ "String" ], "RegionList": [ "String" ], "AdminRole": "String", "ExecutionRole": "String"}}  You cannot have both a LAUNCH and a STACKSET constraint. You also cannot have more than one STACKSET constraint on a product and portfolio. Products with a STACKSET constraint will launch an CloudFormation stack set.  TEMPLATE  Specify the Rules property.

This key allows an administrator to call UpdateProvisionedProductProperties to update the launch role that is associated with a provisioned product. This role is used when an end user calls a provisioning operation such as UpdateProvisionedProduct, TerminateProvisionedProduct, or ExecuteProvisionedProductServiceAction. Only a role ARN is valid. A user ARN is invalid.  The OWNER key accepts user ARNs, IAM role ARNs, and STS  assumed-role ARNs. The owner is the user that has permission to see, update, terminate, and  execute service actions in the provisioned product. The administrator can change the owner of a provisioned product to another IAM or STS entity within the  same account. Both end user owners and administrators can see ownership history of the provisioned  product using the ListRecordHistory API. The new owner can describe all past records  for the provisioned product using the DescribeRecord API. The previous owner can no  longer use DescribeRecord, but can still see the product's history from when he was  an owner using ListRecordHistory. If a provisioned product ownership is assigned to an end user, they can see and perform any action through the API or  Service Catalog console such as update, terminate, and execute service actions.  If an end user provisions a product and the owner is updated to someone else, they will no longer be able to see or perform any actions through  API or the Service Catalog console on that provisioned product.
