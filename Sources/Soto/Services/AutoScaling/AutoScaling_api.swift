However, if you configure a mixed instances policy that defines weights for the instance types, you must specify these sizes with the same units that you use for weighting instances.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - autoScalingGroupName: The name of the Auto Scaling group. This name must be unique per Region per account. The name can contain any ASCII character 33 to 126 including most punctuation characters, digits, and upper and lowercased letters.  You cannot use a colon (:) in the name.
    ///   - availabilityZoneDistribution: The instance capacity distribution across Availability Zones.
    ///   - availabilityZoneImpairmentPolicy:  The policy for Availability Zone impairment.
    ///   - availabilityZones: A list of Availability Zones where instances in the Auto Scaling group can be created. Used for launching into the default VPC subnet in each Availability Zone when not using the VPCZoneIdentifier property, or for attaching a network interface when an existing network interface ID is specified in a launch template.
    ///   - capacityRebalance: Indicates whether Capacity Rebalancing is enabled. Otherwise, Capacity Rebalancing is disabled. When you turn on Capacity Rebalancing, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to launch a Spot Instance whenever Amazon EC2 notifies that a Spot Instance is at an elevated risk of interruption. After launching a new instance, it then terminates an old instance. For more information, see Use Capacity Rebalancing to handle Amazon EC2 Spot Interruptions in the in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - capacityReservationSpecification:  The capacity reservation specification for the Auto Scaling group.
    ///   - context: Reserved.
    ///   - defaultCooldown:  Only needed if you use simple scaling policies.  The amount of time, in seconds, between one scaling activity ending and another one starting due to simple scaling policies. For more information, see Scaling cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. Default: 300 seconds
    ///   - defaultInstanceWarmup: The amount of time, in seconds, until a new instance is considered to have finished initializing and resource consumption to become stable after it enters the InService state.  During an instance refresh, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the warm-up period after it replaces an instance before it moves on to replacing the next instance. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling also waits for the warm-up period before aggregating the metrics for new instances with existing instances in the Amazon CloudWatch metrics that are used for scaling, resulting in more reliable usage data. For more information, see Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.  To manage various warm-up settings at the group level, we recommend that you set the default instance warmup, even if it is set to 0 seconds. To remove a value that you previously set, include the property but specify -1 for the value. However, we strongly recommend keeping the default instance warmup enabled by specifying a value of 0 or other nominal value.  Default: None
    ///   - desiredCapacity: The desired capacity is the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling group at the time of its creation and the capacity it attempts to maintain. It can scale beyond this capacity if you configure auto scaling. This number must be greater than or equal to the minimum size of the group and less than or equal to the maximum size of the group. If you do not specify a desired capacity, the default is the minimum size of the group.
    ///   - desiredCapacityType: The unit of measurement for the value specified for desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports DesiredCapacityType for attribute-based instance type selection only. For more information, see Create a mixed instances group using attribute-based instance type selection in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling specifies units, which translates into number of instances. Valid values: units | vcpu | memory-mib
    ///   - healthCheckGracePeriod: The amount of time, in seconds, that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits before checking the health status of an EC2 instance that has come into service and marking it unhealthy due to a failed health check. This is useful if your instances do not immediately pass their health checks after they enter the InService state. For more information, see Set the health check grace period for an Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. Default: 0 seconds
    ///   - healthCheckType: A comma-separated value string of one or more health check types. The valid values are EC2, EBS, ELB, and VPC_LATTICE. EC2 is the default health check and cannot be disabled. For more information, see Health checks for instances in an Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. Only specify EC2 if you must clear a value that was previously set.
    ///   - instanceId: The ID of the instance used to base the launch configuration on. If specified, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses the configuration values from the specified instance to create a new launch configuration. To get the instance ID, use the Amazon EC2 DescribeInstances API operation. For more information, see Create an Auto Scaling group using parameters from an existing instance in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - instanceMaintenancePolicy: An instance maintenance policy. For more information, see Set instance maintenance policy in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.

    ///   - launchTemplate: Information used to specify the launch template and version to use to launch instances.  Conditional: You must specify either a launch template (LaunchTemplate or MixedInstancesPolicy) or a launch configuration (LaunchConfigurationName or InstanceId).  The launch template that is specified must be configured for use with an Auto Scaling group. For more information, see Create a launch template for an Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - lifecycleHookSpecificationList: One or more lifecycle hooks to add to the Auto Scaling group before instances are launched.
    ///   - loadBalancerNames: A list of Classic Load Balancers associated with this Auto Scaling group. For Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Gateway Load Balancers, specify the TargetGroupARNs property instead.
    ///   - maxInstanceLifetime: The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an instance can be in service. The default is null. If specified, the value must be either 0 or a number equal to or greater than 86,400 seconds (1 day). For more information, see Replace Auto Scaling instances based on maximum instance lifetime in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - maxSize: The maximum size of the group.  With a mixed instances policy that uses instance weighting, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may need to go above MaxSize to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will never go above MaxSize by more than your largest instance weight (weights that define how many units each instance contributes to the desired capacity of the group).
    ///   - minSize: The minimum size of the group.
    ///   - mixedInstancesPolicy: The mixed instances policy. For more information, see Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types and purchase options in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - newInstancesProtectedFromScaleIn: Indicates whether newly launched instances are protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. For more information about preventing instances from terminating on scale in, see Use instance scale-in protection in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - placementGroup: The name of the placement group into which to launch your instances. For more information, see Placement groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.  A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. You cannot specify multiple Availability Zones and a cluster placement group.
    ///   - serviceLinkedRoleARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service-linked role that the Auto Scaling group uses to call other Amazon Web Services service on your behalf. By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling uses a service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForAutoScaling, which it creates if it does not exist. For more information, see Service-linked roles in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - skipZonalShiftValidation:  If you enable zonal shift with cross-zone disabled load balancers, capacity could become imbalanced across Availability Zones. To skip the validation, specify true. For more information, see Auto Scaling group zonal shift in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - tags: One or more tags. You can tag your Auto Scaling group and propagate the tags to the Amazon EC2 instances it launches. Tags are not propagated to Amazon EBS volumes. To add tags to Amazon EBS volumes, specify the tags in a launch template but use caution. If the launch template specifies an instance tag with a key that is also specified for the Auto Scaling group, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling overrides the value of that instance tag with the value specified by the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see Tag Auto Scaling groups and instances in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - targetGroupARNs: The Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the Elastic Load Balancing target groups to associate with the Auto Scaling group. Instances are registered as targets with the target groups. The target groups receive incoming traffic and route requests to one or more registered targets. For more information, see Use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across the instances in your Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - terminationPolicies: A policy or a list of policies that are used to select the instance to terminate. These policies are executed in the order that you list them.

The force delete operation will also terminate the EC2 instances. If the group has a warm pool, the force delete option also deletes the warm pool. To remove instances from the Auto Scaling group before deleting it, call the  DetachInstances API with the list of instances and the option to decrement the desired capacity. This ensures that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does not launch replacement instances. To terminate all instances before deleting the Auto Scaling group, call the  UpdateAutoScalingGroup API and set the minimum size and desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group to zero. If the group has scaling policies, deleting the group deletes the policies, the underlying alarm actions, and any alarm that no longer has an associated action.

Lifecycle hooks let you create solutions that are aware of events in the Auto Scaling instance lifecycle, and then perform a custom action on instances when the corresponding lifecycle event occurs. This step is a part of the procedure for adding a lifecycle hook to an Auto Scaling group:   (Optional) Create a launch template or launch configuration with a user data script that runs while an instance is in a wait state due to a lifecycle hook.   (Optional) Create a Lambda function and a rule that allows Amazon EventBridge to invoke your Lambda function when an instance is put into a wait state due to a lifecycle hook.

If you associate a new launch configuration or template with an Auto Scaling group, all new instances will get the updated configuration. Existing instances continue to run with the configuration that they were originally launched with. When you update a group to specify a mixed instances policy instead of a launch configuration or template, existing instances may be replaced to match the new purchasing options that you specified in the policy. For example, if the group currently has 100% On-Demand capacity and the policy specifies 50% Spot capacity, this means that half of your instances will be gradually terminated and relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, so that updating your group does not compromise the performance or availability of your application. Note the following about changing DesiredCapacity, MaxSize, or MinSize:   If a scale-in activity occurs as a result of a new DesiredCapacity value that is lower than the current size of the group, the Auto Scaling group uses its termination policy to determine which instances to terminate.   If you specify a new value for MinSize without specifying a value for DesiredCapacity, and the new MinSize is larger than the current size of the group, this sets the group's DesiredCapacity to the new MinSize value.   If you specify a new value for MaxSize without specifying a value for DesiredCapacity, and the new MaxSize is smaller than the current size of the group, this sets the group's DesiredCapacity to the new MaxSize value.

    ///   - autoScalingGroupName: The name of the Auto Scaling group.
    ///   - availabilityZoneDistribution:  The instance capacity distribution across Availability Zones.
    ///   - availabilityZoneImpairmentPolicy:  The policy for Availability Zone impairment.
    ///   - availabilityZones: One or more Availability Zones for the group.
    ///   - capacityRebalance: Enables or disables Capacity Rebalancing. For more information, see Use Capacity Rebalancing to handle Amazon EC2 Spot Interruptions in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - capacityReservationSpecification:  The capacity reservation specification for the Auto Scaling group.
    ///   - context: Reserved.
    ///   - defaultCooldown:  Only needed if you use simple scaling policies.  The amount of time, in seconds, between one scaling activity ending and another one starting due to simple scaling policies. For more information, see Scaling cooldowns for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - defaultInstanceWarmup: The amount of time, in seconds, until a new instance is considered to have finished initializing and resource consumption to become stable after it enters the InService state.  During an instance refresh, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits for the warm-up period after it replaces an instance before it moves on to replacing the next instance. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling also waits for the warm-up period before aggregating the metrics for new instances with existing instances in the Amazon CloudWatch metrics that are used for scaling, resulting in more reliable usage data. For more information, see Set the default instance warmup for an Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.  To manage various warm-up settings at the group level, we recommend that you set the default instance warmup, even if it is set to 0 seconds. To remove a value that you previously set, include the property but specify -1 for the value. However, we strongly recommend keeping the default instance warmup enabled by specifying a value of 0 or other nominal value.
    ///   - desiredCapacity: The desired capacity is the initial capacity of the Auto Scaling group after this operation completes and the capacity it attempts to maintain. This number must be greater than or equal to the minimum size of the group and less than or equal to the maximum size of the group.
    ///   - desiredCapacityType: The unit of measurement for the value specified for desired capacity. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling supports DesiredCapacityType for attribute-based instance type selection only. For more information, see Create a mixed instances group using attribute-based instance type selection in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling specifies units, which translates into number of instances. Valid values: units | vcpu | memory-mib
    ///   - healthCheckGracePeriod: The amount of time, in seconds, that Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling waits before checking the health status of an EC2 instance that has come into service and marking it unhealthy due to a failed health check. This is useful if your instances do not immediately pass their health checks after they enter the InService state. For more information, see Set the health check grace period for an Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - healthCheckType: A comma-separated value string of one or more health check types. The valid values are EC2, EBS, ELB, and VPC_LATTICE. EC2 is the default health check and cannot be disabled. For more information, see Health checks for instances in an Auto Scaling group in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. Only specify EC2 if you must clear a value that was previously set.
    ///   - instanceMaintenancePolicy: An instance maintenance policy. For more information, see Set instance maintenance policy in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - launchConfigurationName: The name of the launch configuration. If you specify LaunchConfigurationName in your update request, you can't specify LaunchTemplate or MixedInstancesPolicy.
    ///   - launchTemplate: The launch template and version to use to specify the updates. If you specify LaunchTemplate in your update request, you can't specify LaunchConfigurationName or MixedInstancesPolicy.
    ///   - maxInstanceLifetime: The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that an instance can be in service. The default is null. If specified, the value must be either 0 or a number equal to or greater than 86,400 seconds (1 day). To clear a previously set value, specify a new value of 0. For more information, see Replacing Auto Scaling instances based on maximum instance lifetime in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - maxSize: The maximum size of the Auto Scaling group.  With a mixed instances policy that uses instance weighting, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling may need to go above MaxSize to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling will never go above MaxSize by more than your largest instance weight (weights that define how many units each instance contributes to the desired capacity of the group).
    ///   - minSize: The minimum size of the Auto Scaling group.
    ///   - mixedInstancesPolicy: The mixed instances policy. For more information, see Auto Scaling groups with multiple instance types and purchase options in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - newInstancesProtectedFromScaleIn: Indicates whether newly launched instances are protected from termination by Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling when scaling in. For more information about preventing instances from terminating on scale in, see Use instance scale-in protection in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - placementGroup: The name of an existing placement group into which to launch your instances. To remove the placement group setting, pass an empty string for placement-group. For more information about placement groups, see Placement groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.  A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. You cannot specify multiple Availability Zones and a cluster placement group.
    ///   - serviceLinkedRoleARN: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the service-linked role that the Auto Scaling group uses to call other Amazon Web Services on your behalf. For more information, see Service-linked roles in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - skipZonalShiftValidation:  If you enable zonal shift with cross-zone disabled load balancers, capacity could become imbalanced across Availability Zones. To skip the validation, specify true. For more information, see Auto Scaling group zonal shift in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide.
    ///   - terminationPolicies: A policy or a list of policies that are used to select the instances to terminate. The policies are executed in the order that you list them. For more information, see Configure termination policies for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide. Valid values: Default | AllocationStrategy | ClosestToNextInstanceHour | NewestInstance | OldestInstance | OldestLaunchConfiguration | OldestLaunchTemplate | arn:aws:lambda:region:account-id:function:my-function:my-alias
