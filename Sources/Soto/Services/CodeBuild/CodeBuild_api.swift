/// Service object for interacting with AWS CodeBuild service.

/// CodeBuild CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming languages and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in CodeBuild to use your own build tools. CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay only for the build time you consume. For more information about CodeBuild, see the  CodeBuild User Guide.

If this value is set, it can be either an inline buildspec definition, the path to an alternate buildspec file relative to the value of the built-in CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR environment variable, or the path to an S3 bucket. The bucket must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the build project. Specify the buildspec file using its ARN (for example, arn:aws:s3:::my-codebuild-sample2/buildspec.yml). If this value is not provided or is set to an empty string, the source code must contain a buildspec file in its root directory. For more information, see Buildspec File Name and Storage Location.

You can use a cross-account KMS key to encrypt the build output artifacts if your service role has permission to that key.   You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CMK or, if available, the CMK's alias (using the format alias/).
    ///   - environmentTypeOverride: A container type for this batch build that overrides the one specified in the batch build project.

    ///   - idempotencyToken: A unique, case sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the idempotency of the StartBuildBatch request. The token is included in the StartBuildBatch request and is valid for five minutes. If you repeat the StartBuildBatch request with the same token, but change a parameter, CodeBuild returns a parameter mismatch error.
    ///   - imageOverride: The name of an image for this batch build that overrides the one specified in the batch build project.
    ///   - imagePullCredentialsTypeOverride: The type of credentials CodeBuild uses to pull images in your batch build. There are two valid values:   CODEBUILD  Specifies that CodeBuild uses its own credentials. This requires that you modify your ECR repository policy to trust CodeBuild's service principal.  SERVICE_ROLE  Specifies that CodeBuild uses your build project's service role.    When using a cross-account or private registry image, you must use SERVICE_ROLE credentials. When using an CodeBuild curated image, you must use CODEBUILD credentials.
    ///   - insecureSslOverride: Enable this flag to override the insecure SSL setting that is specified in the batch build project. The insecure SSL setting determines whether to ignore SSL warnings while connecting to the project source code. This override applies only if the build's source is GitHub Enterprise.

    ///   - privilegedModeOverride: Enable this flag to override privileged mode in the batch build project.

    ///   - registryCredentialOverride: A RegistryCredential object that overrides credentials for access to a private registry.
    ///   - reportBuildBatchStatusOverride: Set to true to report to your source provider the status of a batch build's start and completion. If you use this option with a source provider other than GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Bitbucket, an invalidInputException is thrown.
