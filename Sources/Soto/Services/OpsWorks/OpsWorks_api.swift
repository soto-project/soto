/// OpsWorks Welcome to the OpsWorks Stacks API Reference. This guide provides descriptions, syntax,  and usage examples for OpsWorks Stacks actions and data types, including common parameters and error codes.  OpsWorks Stacks is an application management service that provides an integrated experience for managing the complete application lifecycle. For information about OpsWorks, see the OpsWorks information page.  SDKs and CLI  Use the OpsWorks Stacks API by using the Command Line Interface (CLI) or by using one of the  Amazon Web Services SDKs to implement applications in your preferred language. For more information, see:    CLI     SDK for Java     SDK for .NET     SDK for PHP     SDK for Ruby     Amazon Web Services SDK for Node.js     SDK for Python (Boto)     Endpoints  OpsWorks Stacks supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints.  Stacks can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.   opsworks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks.us-east-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks.us-west-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com (API only; not available in the Amazon Web Services Management Console)   opsworks.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com   opsworks.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com    Chef Versions  When you call CreateStack, CloneStack, or UpdateStack we recommend you use the ConfigurationManager parameter to specify the Chef version. The recommended and default value for Linux stacks is currently 12. Windows stacks use Chef 12.2. For more information, see Chef Versions.  You can specify Chef 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for your Linux stack. We recommend migrating your existing Linux stacks  to Chef 12 as soon as possible.

    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - agentVersion: The default OpsWorks Stacks agent version. You have the following options:   Auto-update - Set this parameter to LATEST. OpsWorks Stacks automatically installs new agent versions on the stack's instances as soon as they are available.   Fixed version - Set this parameter to your preferred agent version. To update  the agent version, you must edit the stack configuration and specify a new version.  OpsWorks Stacks automatically installs that version on the stack's instances.   The default setting is LATEST. To specify an agent version, you must use the complete version number, not the abbreviated number shown on the console. For a list of available agent version numbers, call DescribeAgentVersions. AgentVersion cannot be set to Chef 12.2.  You can also specify an agent version when you create or update an instance, which overrides the stack's  default setting.
    ///   - attributes: A list of stack attributes and values as key/value pairs to be added to the cloned stack.
    ///   - chefConfiguration: A ChefConfiguration object that specifies whether to enable Berkshelf and the Berkshelf version on Chef 11.10 stacks. For more information, see Create a New Stack.
    ///   - cloneAppIds: A list of source stack app IDs to be included in the cloned stack.
    ///   - clonePermissions: Whether to clone the source stack's permissions.
    ///   - configurationManager: The configuration manager. When you clone a stack we recommend that you use the configuration manager to specify the  Chef version: 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for Linux stacks, or 12.2 for Windows stacks. The default value for Linux stacks is currently 12.
    ///   - customCookbooksSource: Contains the information required to retrieve an app or cookbook from a repository. For more information,  see Adding Apps or  Cookbooks and Recipes.
    ///   - customJson: A string that contains user-defined, custom JSON. It is used to override the corresponding default stack configuration  JSON values. The string should be in the following format:  "{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\",...}"  For more information about custom JSON, see Use Custom JSON to Modify the Stack Configuration Attributes
    ///   - defaultAvailabilityZone: The cloned stack's default Availability Zone, which must be in the specified region. For more information, see Regions and Endpoints. If you also specify a value for DefaultSubnetId, the subnet must be in the same zone. For more information, see the VpcId parameter description.
    ///   - defaultInstanceProfileArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM profile that is the default profile for all of the stack's  EC2 instances. For more information about IAM ARNs, see Using Identifiers.
    ///   - defaultOs: The stack's operating system, which must be set to one of the following.   A supported Linux operating system: An Amazon Linux version, such as Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux 2018.03, Amazon Linux 2017.09, Amazon Linux 2017.03, Amazon Linux 2016.09, Amazon Linux 2016.03, Amazon Linux 2015.09, or Amazon Linux 2015.03.   A supported Ubuntu operating system, such as Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, or Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.    CentOS Linux 7     Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7     Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base, Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Express,  Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Standard, or Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Web.   A custom AMI: Custom. You specify the custom AMI you want to use when you create instances. For more information about how to use custom AMIs with OpsWorks, see Using Custom AMIs.   The default option is the parent stack's operating system. Not all operating systems are supported with all versions of Chef. For more information about supported operating systems, see OpsWorks Stacks Operating Systems.  You can specify a different Linux operating system for the cloned stack, but you cannot change from Linux to  Windows or Windows to Linux.
    ///   - defaultRootDeviceType: The default root device type. This value is used by default for all instances in the cloned stack, but you can override it when you create an instance. For more information, see Storage for the Root Device.
    ///   - defaultSshKeyName: A default Amazon EC2 key pair name. The default value is none. If you specify a key pair name,  OpsWorks installs the public key on the instance and you can use the private key with an SSH client to log in to the instance. For more information, see  Using SSH to Communicate with an Instance and  Managing SSH Access. You can override this setting by specifying a different key pair, or no key pair, when you  create an instance.
    ///   - defaultSubnetId: The stack's default VPC subnet ID. This parameter is required if you specify a value for the VpcId parameter. All instances are launched into this subnet unless you specify otherwise when you create the instance. If you also specify a value for DefaultAvailabilityZone, the subnet must be in that zone. For information on default values and when this parameter is required, see the VpcId parameter description.
    ///   - hostnameTheme: The stack's host name theme, with spaces are replaced by underscores. The theme is used to generate host names for the stack's instances. By default, HostnameTheme is set to Layer_Dependent, which creates host names by appending integers to the layer's short name. The other themes are:    Baked_Goods     Clouds     Europe_Cities     Fruits     Greek_Deities_and_Titans     Legendary_creatures_from_Japan     Planets_and_Moons     Roman_Deities     Scottish_Islands     US_Cities     Wild_Cats    To obtain a generated host name, call GetHostNameSuggestion, which returns a host name based on the current theme.
    ///   - name: The cloned stack name. Stack names can be a maximum of 64 characters.
    ///   - region: The cloned stack Amazon Web Services Region, such as ap-northeast-2. For more information  about Amazon Web Services Regions, see Regions and Endpoints.
    ///   - serviceRoleArn: The stack Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, which allows OpsWorks Stacks to work with Amazon Web Services resources on your behalf. You must set this parameter to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an existing IAM role. If you create a stack by using the OpsWorkss Stacks console, it creates the role for you. You can obtain an existing stack's IAM ARN programmatically by calling DescribePermissions. For more information about IAM ARNs, see  Using Identifiers.  You must set this parameter to a valid service role ARN or the action will fail; there is no default value.  You can specify the source stack's service role ARN, if you prefer, but you must do so explicitly.
    ///   - sourceStackId: The source stack ID.
    ///   - useCustomCookbooks: Whether to use custom cookbooks.
    ///   - useOpsworksSecurityGroups: Whether to associate the OpsWorks Stacks built-in security groups with the stack's layers. OpsWorks Stacks provides a standard set of security groups, one for each layer, which are associated with layers by default. With UseOpsworksSecurityGroups you can instead provide your own custom security groups. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups has the following settings:    True - OpsWorks Stacks automatically associates the appropriate built-in security group with  each layer (default setting). You can associate additional security groups with a layer after you create it but you cannot  delete the built-in security group.   False - OpsWorks Stacks does not associate built-in security groups with layers.  You must create appropriate Amazon EC2 security groups and associate a security group with each  layer that you create. However, you can still manually associate a built-in security group with a layer on creation;  custom security groups are required only for those layers that need custom settings.   For more information, see Create a New Stack.
    ///   - vpcId: The ID of the VPC that the cloned stack is to be launched into. It must be in the specified region. All instances are launched into this VPC, and you cannot change the ID later.   If your account supports EC2 Classic, the default value is no VPC.   If your account does not support EC2 Classic, the default value is the default VPC for the specified region.   If the VPC ID corresponds to a default VPC and you have specified either the DefaultAvailabilityZone or the DefaultSubnetId parameter only, OpsWorks Stacks infers the value of the other parameter. If you specify neither parameter, OpsWorks Stacks sets these parameters to the first valid Availability Zone for the specified region and the corresponding default VPC subnet ID, respectively.  If you specify a nondefault VPC ID, note the following:   It must belong to a VPC in your account that is in the specified region.   You must specify a value for DefaultSubnetId.   For more information about how to use OpsWorks Stacks with a VPC, see Running a Stack in a VPC. For more information about default VPC and EC2 Classic, see Supported Platforms.

All instances are launched into this subnet unless you specify otherwise when you create the instance. If you also specify a value for DefaultAvailabilityZone, the subnet must be in that zone. For information on default values and when this parameter is required, see the VpcId parameter description.
    ///   - hostnameTheme: The stack's host name theme, with spaces replaced by underscores. The theme is used to generate host names for the stack's instances. By default, HostnameTheme is set to Layer_Dependent, which creates host names by appending integers to the layer's short name. The other themes are:    Baked_Goods     Clouds     Europe_Cities     Fruits     Greek_Deities_and_Titans     Legendary_creatures_from_Japan     Planets_and_Moons     Roman_Deities     Scottish_Islands     US_Cities     Wild_Cats    To obtain a generated host name, call GetHostNameSuggestion, which returns a host name based on the current theme.
    ///   - name: The stack name. Stack names can be a maximum of 64 characters.
    ///   - region: The stack's Amazon Web Services Region, such as ap-south-1. For more information about Amazon Web Services Regions, see Regions and Endpoints.  In the CLI, this API maps to the --stack-region parameter. If the --stack-region parameter and the CLI common parameter --region are set to the same value, the stack uses a regional endpoint. If the --stack-region parameter is not set, but the CLI --region parameter is, this also results in a stack with a regional endpoint. However, if the --region parameter is set to us-east-1, and the --stack-region parameter is set to one of the following, then the stack uses a legacy or classic region: us-west-1, us-west-2, sa-east-1, eu-central-1, eu-west-1, ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2. In this case, the actual API endpoint of the stack is in us-east-1. Only the preceding regions are supported as classic regions in the us-east-1 API endpoint. Because it is a best practice to choose the regional endpoint that is closest to where you manage Amazon Web Services, we recommend that you use regional endpoints for new stacks. The CLI common --region parameter always specifies a regional API endpoint; it cannot be used to specify a classic OpsWorks Stacks region.
    ///   - serviceRoleArn: The stack's IAM role, which allows OpsWorks Stacks to work with Amazon Web Services resources on your behalf. You must set this parameter to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an existing IAM role. For more information about IAM ARNs, see  Using Identifiers.
    ///   - useCustomCookbooks: Whether the stack uses custom cookbooks.
    ///   - useOpsworksSecurityGroups: Whether to associate the OpsWorks Stacks built-in security groups with the stack's layers. OpsWorks Stacks provides a standard set of built-in security groups, one for each layer, which are associated with layers by default. With UseOpsworksSecurityGroups you can instead provide your own custom security groups. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups has the following settings:    True - OpsWorks Stacks automatically associates the appropriate built-in security group with each  layer (default setting). You can associate additional security groups with a layer after you create it, but you cannot  delete the built-in security group.   False - OpsWorks Stacks does not associate built-in security groups with layers. You must create  appropriate EC2 security groups and associate a security group with each layer that you create. However, you can still  manually associate a built-in security group with a layer on creation; custom security groups are required only for those  layers that need custom settings.   For more information, see Create a New Stack.
    ///   - vpcId: The ID of the VPC that the stack is to be launched into. The VPC must be in the stack's region. All instances are launched  into this VPC. You cannot change the ID later.   If your account supports EC2-Classic, the default value is no VPC.   If your account does not support EC2-Classic, the default value is the default VPC for the specified region.   If the VPC ID corresponds to a default VPC and you have specified either the DefaultAvailabilityZone or the DefaultSubnetId parameter only, OpsWorks Stacks infers the value of the  other parameter. If you specify neither parameter, OpsWorks Stacks sets these parameters to the first valid Availability Zone for the specified region and the corresponding default VPC subnet ID, respectively. If you specify a nondefault VPC ID, note the following:   It must belong to a VPC in your account that is in the specified region.   You must specify a value for DefaultSubnetId.   For more information about how to use OpsWorks Stacks with a VPC, see Running a Stack in a VPC. For more information about default VPC and EC2-Classic, see Supported Platforms.

OpsWorks Stacks automatically installs new agent versions on the stack's instances as soon as they are available.   Fixed version - Set this parameter to your preferred agent version. To update the agent version, you must  edit the stack configuration and specify a new version. OpsWorks Stacks installs that version  on the stack's instances.   The default setting is LATEST. To specify an agent version, you must use the complete version number, not the abbreviated number shown on the console. For a list of available agent version numbers, call DescribeAgentVersions.  AgentVersion cannot be set to Chef 12.2.  You can also specify an agent version when you create or update an instance, which overrides the stack's default  setting.
    ///   - attributes: One or more user-defined key-value pairs to be added to the stack attributes.
    ///   - chefConfiguration: A ChefConfiguration object that specifies whether to enable Berkshelf and the Berkshelf version on Chef 11.10 stacks. For more information, see Create a New Stack.
    ///   - configurationManager: The configuration manager. When you update a stack, we recommend that you use the configuration manager to specify the  Chef version: 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for Linux stacks, or 12.2 for Windows stacks. The default value for Linux stacks is currently 12.
    ///   - customCookbooksSource: Contains the information required to retrieve an app or cookbook from a repository. For more information,  see Adding Apps or  Cookbooks and Recipes.
    ///   - customJson: A string that contains user-defined, custom JSON. It can be used to override the corresponding default stack configuration  JSON values or to pass data to recipes. The string should be in the following format:  "{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\",...}"  For more information about custom JSON, see Use Custom JSON to Modify the Stack Configuration Attributes.
    ///   - defaultAvailabilityZone: The stack's default Availability Zone, which must be in the stack's region. For more information, see Regions and Endpoints. If you also specify a value for DefaultSubnetId, the subnet must be in the same zone. For more information, see CreateStack.
    ///   - defaultInstanceProfileArn: The ARN of an IAM profile that is the default profile for all of the stack's EC2 instances. For more information about IAM ARNs, see Using Identifiers.
    ///   - defaultOs: The stack's operating system, which must be set to one of the following:   A supported Linux operating system: An Amazon Linux version, such as Amazon Linux 2, Amazon Linux 2018.03, Amazon Linux 2017.09, Amazon Linux 2017.03, Amazon Linux 2016.09,  Amazon Linux 2016.03, Amazon Linux 2015.09, or Amazon Linux 2015.03.   A supported Ubuntu operating system, such as Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, or Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.    CentOS Linux 7     Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7    A supported Windows operating system, such as Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Base, Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Express,  Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Standard, or Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Web.   A custom AMI: Custom. You specify the custom AMI you want to use when you create instances. For more information about how to use custom AMIs with OpsWorks, see Using Custom AMIs.   The default option is the stack's current operating system. Not all operating systems are supported with all versions of Chef. For more information about supported operating systems, see OpsWorks Stacks Operating Systems.
    ///   - defaultRootDeviceType: The default root device type. This value is used by default for all instances in the stack, but you can override it when you create an instance. For more information, see Storage for the Root Device.
    ///   - defaultSshKeyName: A default Amazon EC2 key-pair name. The default value is none. If you specify a key-pair name, OpsWorks Stacks installs the public key on the instance and you can use the private key with an SSH client to log in to the instance. For more information, see  Using SSH to Communicate with an Instance and  Managing SSH Access. You can override this setting by specifying a different key pair, or no key pair, when you  create an instance.
    ///   - defaultSubnetId: The stack's default VPC subnet ID. This parameter is required if you specify a value for the VpcId parameter. All instances are launched into this subnet unless you specify otherwise when you create the instance. If you also specify a value for DefaultAvailabilityZone, the subnet must be in that zone. For information on default values and when this parameter is required, see the VpcId parameter description.
    ///   - hostnameTheme: The stack's new host name theme, with spaces replaced by underscores. The theme is used to generate host names for the stack's instances. By default, HostnameTheme is set to Layer_Dependent, which creates host names by appending integers to  the layer's short name. The other themes are:    Baked_Goods     Clouds     Europe_Cities     Fruits     Greek_Deities_and_Titans     Legendary_creatures_from_Japan     Planets_and_Moons     Roman_Deities     Scottish_Islands     US_Cities     Wild_Cats    To obtain a generated host name, call GetHostNameSuggestion, which returns a host name based on the current theme.
    ///   - name: The stack's new name. Stack names can be a maximum of 64 characters.
    ///   - serviceRoleArn: Do not use this parameter. You cannot update a stack's service role.
    ///   - stackId: The stack ID.
    ///   - useCustomCookbooks: Whether the stack uses custom cookbooks.
    ///   - useOpsworksSecurityGroups: Whether to associate the OpsWorks Stacks built-in security groups with the stack's layers. OpsWorks Stacks provides a standard set of built-in security groups, one for each layer, which are associated with layers by default. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups allows you to provide your own custom security groups instead of using the built-in groups. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups has the following settings:    True - OpsWorks Stacks automatically associates the appropriate built-in security group with each  layer (default setting). You can associate additional security groups with a layer after you create it, but you cannot  delete the built-in security group.   False - OpsWorks Stacks does not associate built-in security groups with layers. You must create  appropriate EC2 security groups and associate a security group with each layer that you create. However, you can still  manually associate a built-in security group with a layer on. Custom security groups are required only for those layers  that need custom settings.
