EFS storage  When a domain is created, an EFS volume is created for use by all of the users within the domain. Each user receives a private home directory within the EFS volume for notebooks, Git repositories, and data files. SageMaker uses the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt the EFS volume attached to the domain with an AWS managed customer master key (CMK) by default. For more control, you can specify a customer managed CMK. For more information, see Protect Data at Rest Using Encryption.  VPC configuration  All SageMaker Studio traffic between the domain and the EFS volume is through the specified VPC and subnets. For other Studio traffic, you can specify the AppNetworkAccessType parameter. AppNetworkAccessType corresponds to the network access type that you choose when you onboard to Studio.

VpcOnly - All Studio traffic is through the specified VPC and subnets. Internet access is disabled by default. To allow internet access, you must specify a NAT gateway. When internet access is disabled, you won't be able to run a Studio notebook or to train or host models unless your VPC has an interface endpoint to the SageMaker API and runtime or a NAT gateway and your security groups allow outbound connections.   For more information, see Connect SageMaker Studio Notebooks to Resources in a VPC.

    /// Creates an endpoint using the endpoint configuration specified in the request. Amazon SageMaker uses the endpoint to provision resources and deploy models. You create the endpoint configuration with the CreateEndpointConfig API.   Use this API to deploy models using Amazon SageMaker hosting services.  For an example that calls this method when deploying a model to Amazon SageMaker hosting services, see Deploy the Model to Amazon SageMaker Hosting Services (AWS SDK for Python (Boto 3)).    You must not delete an EndpointConfig that is in use by an endpoint that is live or while the UpdateEndpoint or CreateEndpoint operations are being performed on the endpoint. To update an endpoint, you must create a new EndpointConfig.  The endpoint name must be unique within an AWS Region in your AWS account.  When it receives the request, Amazon SageMaker creates the endpoint, launches the resources (ML compute instances), and deploys the model(s) on them.   When you call CreateEndpoint, a load call is made to DynamoDB to verify that your endpoint configuration exists. When you read data from a DynamoDB table supporting  Eventually Consistent Reads , the response might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The response might include some stale data. If the dependent entities are not yet in DynamoDB, this causes a validation error. If you repeat your read request after a short time, the response should return the latest data. So retry logic is recommended to handle these possible issues. We also recommend that customers call DescribeEndpointConfig before calling CreateEndpoint to minimize the potential impact of a DynamoDB eventually consistent read.  When Amazon SageMaker receives the request, it sets the endpoint status to Creating. After it creates the endpoint, it sets the status to InService. Amazon SageMaker can then process incoming requests for inferences. To check the status of an endpoint, use the DescribeEndpoint API. If any of the models hosted at this endpoint get model data from an Amazon S3 location, Amazon SageMaker uses AWS Security Token Service to download model artifacts from the S3 path you provided. AWS STS is activated in your IAM user account by default. If you previously deactivated AWS STS for a region, you need to reactivate AWS STS for that region. For more information, see Activating and Deactivating AWS STS in an AWS Region in the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.   To add the IAM role policies for using this API operation, go to the IAM console, and choose Roles in the left navigation pane. Search the IAM role that you want to grant access to use the CreateEndpoint and CreateEndpointConfig API operations, add the following policies to the role.    Option 1: For a full Amazon SageMaker access, search and attach the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess policy.   Option 2: For granting a limited access to an IAM role, paste the following Action elements manually into the JSON file of the IAM role:   "Action": ["sagemaker:CreateEndpoint", "sagemaker:CreateEndpointConfig"]   "Resource": [   "arn:aws:sagemaker:region:account-id:endpoint/endpointName"   "arn:aws:sagemaker:region:account-id:endpoint-config/endpointConfigName"   ]  For more information, see Amazon SageMaker API Permissions: Actions, Permissions, and Resources Reference.

In the configuration, you identify one or more models, created using the CreateModel API, to deploy and the resources that you want Amazon SageMaker to provision. Then you call the CreateEndpoint API.   Use this API if you want to use Amazon SageMaker hosting services to deploy models into production.   In the request, you define a ProductionVariant, for each model that you want to deploy. Each ProductionVariant parameter also describes the resources that you want Amazon SageMaker to provision. This includes the number and type of ML compute instances to deploy.  If you are hosting multiple models, you also assign a VariantWeight to specify how much traffic you want to allocate to each model. For example, suppose that you want to host two models, A and B, and you assign traffic weight 2 for model A and 1 for model B. Amazon SageMaker distributes two-thirds of the traffic to Model A, and one-third to model B.  For an example that calls this method when deploying a model to Amazon SageMaker hosting services, see Deploy the Model to Amazon SageMaker Hosting Services (AWS SDK for Python (Boto 3)).

You can also use automated data labeling to reduce the number of data objects that need to be labeled by a human. Automated data labeling uses active learning to determine if a data object can be labeled by machine or if it needs to be sent to a human worker. For more information, see Using Automated Data Labeling. The data objects to be labeled are contained in an Amazon S3 bucket. You create a manifest file that describes the location of each object. For more information, see Using Input and Output Data. The output can be used as the manifest file for another labeling job or as training data for your machine learning models. You can use this operation to create a static labeling job or a streaming labeling job. A static labeling job stops if all data objects in the input manifest file identified in ManifestS3Uri have been labeled. A streaming labeling job runs perpetually until it is manually stopped, or remains idle for 10 days. You can send new data objects to an active (InProgress) streaming labeling job in real time.

In a CreateNotebookInstance request, specify the type of ML compute instance that you want to run. Amazon SageMaker launches the instance, installs common libraries that you can use to explore datasets for model training, and attaches an ML storage volume to the notebook instance.  Amazon SageMaker also provides a set of example notebooks. Each notebook demonstrates how to use Amazon SageMaker with a specific algorithm or with a machine learning framework.  After receiving the request, Amazon SageMaker does the following:   Creates a network interface in the Amazon SageMaker VPC.   (Option) If you specified SubnetId, Amazon SageMaker creates a network interface in your own VPC, which is inferred from the subnet ID that you provide in the input. When creating this network interface, Amazon SageMaker attaches the security group that you specified in the request to the network interface that it creates in your VPC.   Launches an EC2 instance of the type specified in the request in the Amazon SageMaker VPC. If you specified SubnetId of your VPC, Amazon SageMaker specifies both network interfaces when launching this instance. This enables inbound traffic from your own VPC to the notebook instance, assuming that the security groups allow it.   After creating the notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You can't change the name of a notebook instance after you create it. After Amazon SageMaker creates the notebook instance, you can connect to the Jupyter server and work in Jupyter notebooks. For example, you can write code to explore a dataset that you can use for model training, train a model, host models by creating Amazon SageMaker endpoints, and validate hosted models.
