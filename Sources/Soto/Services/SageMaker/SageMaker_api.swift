You can add tags to experiments, trials, trial components and then use the Search API to search for the tags. To add a description to an experiment, specify the optional Description parameter. To add a description later, or to change the description, call the UpdateExperiment API. To get a list of all your experiments, call the ListExperiments API.

A trial is a set of steps, called trial components, that produce a machine learning model.  In the Studio UI, trials are referred to as run groups and trial components are referred to as runs.  The goal of an experiment is to determine the components that produce the best model. Multiple trials are performed, each one isolating and measuring the impact of a change to one or more inputs, while keeping the remaining inputs constant. When you use SageMaker Studio or the SageMaker Python SDK, all experiments, trials, and trial components are automatically tracked, logged, and indexed. When you use the Amazon Web Services SDK for Python (Boto), you must use the logging APIs provided by the SDK. You can add tags to experiments, trials, trial components and then use the Search API to search for the tags. To add a description to an experiment, specify the optional Description parameter. To add a description later, or to change the description, call the UpdateExperiment API. To get a list of all your experiments, call the ListExperiments API. To view an experiment's properties, call the DescribeExperiment API. To get a list of all the trials associated with an experiment, call the ListTrials API. To create a trial call the CreateTrial API.

Automated data labeling uses active learning to determine if a data object can be labeled by machine or if it needs to be sent to a human worker.

For all other task types, the minimum number of label categories required is one.    Each label category must be unique, you cannot specify duplicate label categories.

    ///   - debugRuleConfigurations: Configuration information for Amazon SageMaker Debugger rules for debugging output tensors.
    ///   - enableInterContainerTrafficEncryption: To encrypt all communications between ML compute instances in distributed training, choose True. Encryption provides greater security for distributed training, but training might take longer. How long it takes depends on the amount of communication between compute instances, especially if you use a deep learning algorithm in distributed training. For more information, see Protect Communications Between ML Compute Instances in a Distributed Training Job.
    ///   - enableManagedSpotTraining: To train models using managed spot training, choose True. Managed spot training provides a fully managed and scalable infrastructure for training machine learning models. this option is useful when training jobs can be interrupted and when there is flexibility when the training job is run.  The complete and intermediate results of jobs are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, and can be used as a starting point to train models incrementally. Amazon SageMaker provides metrics and logs in CloudWatch. They can be used to see when managed spot training jobs are running, interrupted, resumed, or completed.
    ///   - enableNetworkIsolation: Isolates the training container. No inbound or outbound network calls can be made, except for calls between peers within a training cluster for distributed training. If you enable network isolation for training jobs that are configured to use a VPC, SageMaker downloads and uploads customer data and model artifacts through the specified VPC, but the training container does not have network access.

Each key and value is limited to 256 characters, as specified by the Length Constraint.   Do not include any security-sensitive information including account access IDs, secrets or tokens in any hyperparameter field. If the use of security-sensitive credentials are detected, SageMaker will reject your training job request and return an exception error.
    ///   - infraCheckConfig: Contains information about the infrastructure health check configuration for the training job.
    ///   - inputDataConfig: An array of Channel objects. Each channel is a named input source. InputDataConfig describes the input data and its location.  Algorithms can accept input data from one or more channels. For example, an algorithm might have two channels of input data, training_data and validation_data. The configuration for each channel provides the S3, EFS, or FSx location where the input data is stored. It also provides information about the stored data: the MIME type, compression method, and whether the data is wrapped in RecordIO format.  Depending on the input mode that the algorithm supports, SageMaker either copies input data files from an S3 bucket to a local directory in the Docker container, or makes it available as input streams. For example, if you specify an EFS location, input data files are available as input streams. They do not need to be downloaded. Your input must be in the same Amazon Web Services region as your training job.

During model training, SageMaker needs your permission to read input data from an S3 bucket, download a Docker image that contains training code, write model artifacts to an S3 bucket, write logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and publish metrics to Amazon CloudWatch. You grant permissions for all of these tasks to an IAM role. For more information, see SageMaker Roles.   To be able to pass this role to SageMaker, the caller of this API must have the iam:PassRole permission.

    ///   - stoppingCondition: Specifies a limit to how long a model training job can run. It also specifies how long a managed Spot training job has to complete. When the job reaches the time limit, SageMaker ends the training job. Use this API to cap model training costs. To stop a job, SageMaker sends the algorithm the SIGTERM signal, which delays job termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost.

If the execution-parameters endpoint is not enabled, the default value is 1. For more information on execution-parameters, see How Containers Serve Requests. For built-in algorithms, you don't need to set a value for MaxConcurrentTransforms.
    ///   - maxPayloadInMB: The maximum allowed size of the payload, in MB. A payload is the data portion of a record (without metadata). The value in MaxPayloadInMB must be greater than, or equal to, the size of a single record. To estimate the size of a record in MB, divide the size of your dataset by the number of records. To ensure that the records fit within the maximum payload size, we recommend using a slightly larger value. The default value is 6 MB.  The value of MaxPayloadInMB cannot be greater than 100 MB. If you specify the MaxConcurrentTransforms parameter, the value of (MaxConcurrentTransforms * MaxPayloadInMB) also cannot exceed 100 MB. For cases where the payload might be arbitrarily large and is transmitted using HTTP chunked encoding, set the value to 0. This feature works only in supported algorithms. Currently, Amazon SageMaker built-in algorithms do not support HTTP chunked encoding.
