    /// Parameters:
    ///   - cidrIp: The IPv4 address range, in CIDR format.   Amazon Web Services canonicalizes IPv4 and IPv6 CIDRs. For example, if you specify 100.68.0.18/18 for the CIDR block,  Amazon Web Services canonicalizes the CIDR block to 100.68.0.0/18. Any subsequent DescribeSecurityGroups and DescribeSecurityGroupRules calls will  return the canonicalized form of the CIDR block. Additionally, if you attempt to add another rule with the  non-canonical form of the CIDR (such as 100.68.0.18/18) and there is already a rule for the canonicalized  form of the CIDR block (such as 100.68.0.0/18), the API throws an duplicate rule error.  To specify an IPv6 address range, use IP permissions instead. To specify multiple rules and descriptions for the rules, use IP permissions instead.

If you're using AmazonProvidedDNS in any other Region,  specify region.compute.internal. Otherwise, specify a custom domain name. This value is used to complete unqualified DNS hostnames. Some Linux operating systems accept multiple domain names separated by spaces. However, Windows and other Linux operating systems treat the value as a single domain, which results in unexpected behavior. If your DHCP option set is associated with a VPC that has instances running operating systems that treat the value as a single domain, specify only one domain name.    domain-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four DNS servers, or AmazonProvidedDNS. To specify multiple domain name servers in a single parameter,  separate the IP addresses using commas. To have your instances receive custom DNS  hostnames as specified in domain-name, you must specify a custom DNS server.    ntp-servers - The IP addresses of up to eight Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers (four IPv4 addresses and four IPv6 addresses).    netbios-name-servers - The IP addresses of up to four NetBIOS name servers.    netbios-node-type - The NetBIOS node type (1, 2, 4, or 8). We recommend that you specify 2. Broadcast and multicast are not supported. For more information about  NetBIOS node types, see RFC 2132.    ipv6-address-preferred-lease-time - A value (in seconds, minutes, hours, or years) for how frequently a running instance with an IPv6 assigned to it goes through DHCPv6 lease renewal.  Acceptable values are between 140 and 2147483647 seconds (approximately 68 years). If no value is entered, the default lease time is 140 seconds.

    ///   - clientToken: Unique, case-sensitive identifier to ensure idempotency of the request.
    ///   - dryRun: A check for whether you have the required permissions for the action without actually making the request  and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation.  Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
    ///   - persistRoutes: Indicates whether routes should be persisted after all BGP sessions are terminated.
    ///   - persistRoutesDuration: The number of minutes a route server will wait after BGP is re-established to unpersist the routes in the FIB and RIB. Value must be in the range of 1-5. Required if PersistRoutes is enabled. If you set the duration to 1 minute, then when your network appliance re-establishes BGP with route server, it has 1 minute to relearn it's adjacent network and advertise those routes to route server before route server resumes normal functionality. In most cases, 1 minute is probably sufficient. If, however, you have concerns that your BGP network may not be capable of fully re-establishing and re-learning everything in 1 minute, you can increase the duration up to 5 minutes.

    ///   - clientToken: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency  of the request. For more information, see Ensure  Idempotency.
    ///   - dryRun: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,  and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation.  Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
    ///   - encrypted: Indicates whether the volume should be encrypted.  The effect of setting the encryption state to true depends on
    ///   - iops: The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS). For gp3, io1, and io2 volumes, this represents  the number of IOPS that are provisioned for the volume. For gp2 volumes, this represents the baseline  performance of the volume and the rate at which the volume accumulates I/O credits for bursting. The following are the supported values for each volume type:    gp3: 3,000 - 16,000 IOPS    io1: 100 - 64,000 IOPS    io2: 100 - 256,000 IOPS   For io2 volumes, you can achieve up to 256,000 IOPS on
    ///   - kmsKeyId: The identifier of the KMS key to use for Amazon EBS encryption. If this parameter is not specified, your KMS key for Amazon EBS is used. If KmsKeyId is specified, the encrypted state must be true. You can specify the KMS key using any of the following:   Key ID. For example, 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Key alias. For example, alias/ExampleAlias.   Key ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab.   Alias ARN. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.   Amazon Web Services authenticates the KMS key asynchronously. Therefore, if you specify an ID, alias, or ARN that is not valid,  the action can appear to complete, but eventually fails.
    ///   - multiAttachEnabled: Indicates whether to enable Amazon EBS Multi-Attach. If you enable Multi-Attach, you can attach the  volume to up to 16 Instances built on the Nitro System in the same Availability Zone. This parameter is  	supported with io1 and io2 volumes only. For more information,  	see  		Amazon EBS Multi-Attach in the Amazon EBS User Guide.
    ///   - operator: Reserved for internal use.
    ///   - outpostArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost on which to create the volume. If you intend to use a volume with an instance running on an outpost, then you must  create the volume on the same outpost as the instance. You can't use a volume created  in an Amazon Web Services Region with an instance on an Amazon Web Services outpost, or the other way around.
    ///   - size: The size of the volume, in GiBs. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size. If you specify a snapshot, the default is the snapshot size. You can specify a volume  size that is equal to or larger than the snapshot size. The following are the supported volumes sizes for each volume type:    gp2 and gp3: 1 - 16,384 GiB    io1: 4 - 16,384 GiB    io2: 4 - 65,536 GiB    st1 and sc1: 125 - 16,384 GiB    standard: 1 - 1024 GiB
    ///   - snapshotId: The snapshot from which to create the volume. You must specify either a snapshot ID or a volume size.
    ///   - tagSpecifications: The tags to apply to the volume during creation.

To list only Windows instances, use windows.    platform-details - The platform (Linux/UNIX | Red Hat BYOL Linux |  Red Hat Enterprise Linux | Red Hat Enterprise Linux with HA | Red Hat Enterprise Linux with SQL Server Standard and HA | Red Hat Enterprise Linux with SQL Server Enterprise and HA | Red Hat Enterprise Linux with SQL Server Standard | Red Hat Enterprise Linux with SQL Server Web | Red Hat Enterprise Linux with SQL Server Enterprise | SQL Server Enterprise | SQL Server Standard | SQL Server Web | SUSE Linux | Ubuntu Pro | Windows | Windows BYOL | Windows with SQL Server Enterprise | Windows with SQL Server Standard | Windows with SQL Server Web).    private-dns-name - The private IPv4 DNS name of the instance.    private-dns-name-options.enable-resource-name-dns-a-record - A Boolean that indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames with DNS A records.    private-dns-name-options.enable-resource-name-dns-aaaa-record - A Boolean that indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames with DNS AAAA records.    private-dns-name-options.hostname-type - The type of hostname (ip-name | resource-name).    private-ip-address - The private IPv4 address of the instance. This can only be used to filter by the primary IP address of the network interface attached to the instance. To filter by additional IP addresses assigned to the network interface, use the filter network-interface.addresses.private-ip-address.    product-code - The product code associated with the AMI used to launch the instance.    product-code.type - The type of product code (devpay | marketplace).    ramdisk-id - The RAM disk ID.    reason - The reason for the current state of the instance (for example, shows "User Initiated [date]" when you stop or terminate the instance). Similar to the state-reason-code filter.    requester-id - The ID of the entity that launched the instance on your behalf (for example, Amazon Web Services Management Console, Auto Scaling, and so on).    reservation-id - The ID of the instance's reservation. A reservation ID is created any time you launch an instance. A reservation ID has a one-to-one relationship with an instance launch request, but can be associated with more than one instance if you launch multiple instances using the same launch request. For example, if you launch one instance, you get one reservation ID. If you launch ten instances using the same launch request, you also get one reservation ID.    root-device-name - The device name of the root device volume (for example, /dev/sda1).    root-device-type - The type of the root device volume (ebs | instance-store).    source-dest-check - Indicates whether the instance performs source/destination checking. A value of true means that checking is enabled, and false means that checking is disabled. The value must be false for the instance to perform network address translation (NAT) in your VPC.     spot-instance-request-id - The ID of the Spot Instance request.    state-reason-code - The reason code for the state change.    state-reason-message - A message that describes the state change.    subnet-id - The ID of the subnet for the instance.    tag: - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA, specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources that have a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.    tenancy - The tenancy of an instance (dedicated | default | host).    tpm-support - Indicates if the instance is configured for NitroTPM support (v2.0).     usage-operation - The usage operation value for the instance (RunInstances | RunInstances:00g0 | RunInstances:0010 | RunInstances:1010 | RunInstances:1014 | RunInstances:1110 | RunInstances:0014 | RunInstances:0210 | RunInstances:0110 | RunInstances:0100 | RunInstances:0004 | RunInstances:0200 | RunInstances:000g | RunInstances:0g00 | RunInstances:0002 | RunInstances:0800 | RunInstances:0102 | RunInstances:0006 | RunInstances:0202).    usage-operation-update-time - The time that the usage operation was last updated, for example, 2022-09-15T17:15:20.000Z.    virtualization-type - The virtualization type of the instance (paravirtual | hvm).    vpc-id - The ID of the VPC that the instance is running in.

    /// Describes the specified Spot Instance requests. You can use DescribeSpotInstanceRequests to find a running Spot Instance by examining the response. If the status of the Spot Instance is fulfilled, the instance ID appears in the response and contains the identifier of the instance. Alternatively, you can use DescribeInstances with a filter to look for instances where the instance lifecycle is spot. We recommend that you set MaxResults to a value between 5 and 1000 to limit the number of items returned. This paginates the output, which makes the list more manageable and returns the items faster. If the list of items exceeds your MaxResults value, then that number of items is returned along with a NextToken value that can be passed to a subsequent DescribeSpotInstanceRequests request to retrieve the remaining items. Spot Instance requests are deleted four hours after they are canceled and their instances are terminated.

The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs. Volume actions notify you if any action needs to be taken in response to the event. The DescribeVolumeStatus operation provides the following information about the specified volumes:  Status: Reflects the current status of the volume. The possible values are ok, impaired , warning, or insufficient-data. If all checks pass, the overall status of the volume is ok. If the check fails, the overall status is impaired. If the status is insufficient-data, then the checks might still be taking place on your volume at the time. We recommend that you retry the request. For more information about volume status, see Monitor the status of your volumes in the Amazon EBS User Guide.  Events: Reflect the cause of a volume status and might require you to take action. For example, if your volume returns an impaired status, then the volume event might be potential-data-inconsistency. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and might have inconsistent data.  Actions: Reflect the actions you might have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is impaired and the volume event shows potential-data-inconsistency, then the action shows enable-volume-io. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the EnableVolumeIO action and then check the volume for data consistency. Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state. Therefore, volume status does not indicate volumes in the error state (for example, when a volume is incapable of accepting I/O.)

If a KmsKeyId is specified, the Encrypted flag must also be set.  The KMS key identifier may be provided in any of the following formats:    Key ID   Key alias   ARN using key ID. The ID ARN contains the arn:aws:kms namespace, followed by the Region of the key, the Amazon Web Services account ID of the key owner, the key namespace, and then the key ID.

For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:alias/ExampleAlias.    Amazon Web Services parses KmsKeyId asynchronously, meaning that the action you call may appear to complete even though you provided an invalid identifier.

This includes a network interface that's created when launching an instance into the subnet (the instance therefore receives an IPv6 address).  If you enable the IPv6 addressing feature for your subnet, your network interface or instance only receives an IPv6 address if it's created using version 2016-11-15 or later of the Amazon EC2 API.
    ///   - customerOwnedIpv4Pool: The customer-owned IPv4 address pool associated with the subnet. You must set this value when you specify true for MapCustomerOwnedIpOnLaunch.
    ///   - disableLniAtDeviceIndex:  Specify true to indicate that local network interfaces at the current  position should be disabled.
    ///   - enableDns64: Indicates whether DNS queries made to the Amazon-provided DNS Resolver in this subnet  should return synthetic IPv6 addresses for IPv4-only destinations. You must first configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet (separate from the subnet  containing the IPv6-only workloads). For example, the subnet containing the NAT gateway  should have a 0.0.0.0/0 route pointing to the internet gateway. For more  information, see Configure DNS64 and NAT64 in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

For more information about creating AMIs, see Create an AMI from a snapshot and Create an instance-store backed AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.  For Amazon EBS-backed instances, CreateImage creates and registers the AMI in a single request, so you don't have to register the AMI yourself. We recommend that you always use CreateImage unless you have a specific reason to use RegisterImage.  If needed, you can deregister an AMI at any time. Any modifications you make to an AMI backed by an instance store volume invalidates its registration. If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous image and register the new image.  Register a snapshot of a root device volume  You can use RegisterImage to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the snapshot using a block device mapping. You can't set the encryption state of the volume using the block device mapping. If the snapshot is encrypted, or encryption by default is enabled, the root volume of an instance launched from the AMI is encrypted. For more information, see Create an AMI from a snapshot and Use encryption with Amazon EBS-backed AMIs in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.  Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes  If any snapshots have Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes, they are copied to the new AMI. In most cases, AMIs for Windows, RedHat, SUSE, and SQL Server require correct licensing information to be present on the AMI. For more information, see Understand AMI billing information in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. When creating an AMI from a snapshot, the RegisterImage operation derives the correct billing information from the snapshot's metadata, but this requires the appropriate metadata to be present. To verify if the correct billing information was applied, check the PlatformDetails field on the new AMI. If the field is empty or doesn't match the expected operating system code (for example, Windows, RedHat, SUSE, or SQL), the AMI creation was unsuccessful, and you should discard the AMI and instead create the AMI from an instance using CreateImage. For more information, see Create an AMI from an instance  in the Amazon EC2 User Guide. If you purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an On-Demand Instance that was launched from an AMI with a billing product code, make sure that the Reserved Instance has the matching billing product code. If you purchase a Reserved Instance without the matching billing product code, the Reserved Instance will not be applied to the On-Demand Instance.

    ///   - architecture: The architecture of the AMI. Default: For Amazon EBS-backed AMIs, i386. For instance store-backed AMIs, the architecture specified in the manifest file.
    ///   - billingProducts: The billing product codes. Your account must be authorized to specify billing product codes. If your account is not authorized to specify billing product codes, you can publish AMIs that include billable software and list them on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace. You must first register as a seller on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace. For more information, see Getting started as a seller and AMI-based products in the Amazon Web Services Marketplace Seller Guide.
    ///   - blockDeviceMappings: The block device mapping entries. If you specify an Amazon EBS volume using the ID of an Amazon EBS snapshot, you can't specify the encryption state of the volume. If you create an AMI on an Outpost, then all backing snapshots must be on the same Outpost or in the Region of that Outpost. AMIs on an Outpost that include local snapshots can be used to launch instances on the same Outpost only. For more information, Amazon EBS local snapshots on Outposts in the Amazon EBS User Guide.
    ///   - bootMode: The boot mode of the AMI. A value of uefi-preferred indicates that the AMI supports both UEFI and Legacy BIOS.  The operating system contained in the AMI must be configured to support the specified boot mode.  For more information, see Boot modes in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

    ///   - dryRun: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,
    ///   - enaSupport: Set to true to enable enhanced networking with ENA for the AMI and any instances that you launch from the AMI. This option is supported only for HVM AMIs. Specifying this option with a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI unreachable.
    ///   - imageLocation: The full path to your AMI manifest in Amazon S3 storage. The specified bucket must have the aws-exec-read canned access control list (ACL) to ensure that it can be accessed by Amazon EC2. For more information, see Canned ACLs in the Amazon S3 Service Developer Guide.
    ///   - imdsSupport: Set to v2.0 to indicate that IMDSv2 is specified in the AMI. Instances launched from this AMI will have HttpTokens automatically set to required so that, by default, the instance requires that IMDSv2 is used when requesting instance metadata. In addition, HttpPutResponseHopLimit is set to 2. For more information, see Configure the AMI in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.  If you set the value to v2.0, make sure that your AMI software can support IMDSv2.
    ///   - kernelId: The ID of the kernel.
    ///   - name: A name for your AMI. Constraints: 3-128 alphanumeric characters, parentheses (()), square brackets ([]), spaces ( ), periods (.), slashes (/), dashes (-), single quotes ('), at-signs (@), or underscores(_)
    ///   - ramdiskId: The ID of the RAM disk.
    ///   - rootDeviceName: The device name of the root device volume (for example, /dev/sda1).
    ///   - sriovNetSupport: Set to simple to enable enhanced networking with the Intel 82599 Virtual Function interface for the AMI and any instances that you launch from the AMI. There is no way to disable sriovNetSupport at this time. This option is supported only for HVM AMIs. Specifying this option with a PV AMI can make instances launched from the AMI unreachable.
    ///   - tagSpecifications: The tags to apply to the AMI. To tag the AMI, the value for ResourceType must be image. If you specify another value for ResourceType, the request fails. To tag an AMI after it has been registered, see CreateTags.
    ///   - tpmSupport: Set to v2.0 to enable Trusted Platform Module (TPM) support. For more information, see NitroTPM in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

We strongly discourage using the RequestSpotInstances API because it is a legacy API with no planned investment. For options for requesting Spot Instances, see Which is the best Spot request method to use? in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.
    ///
    /// Parameters:
    ///   - availabilityZoneGroup: The user-specified name for a logical grouping of requests. When you specify an Availability Zone group in a Spot Instance request, all Spot Instances in the request are launched in the same Availability Zone. Instance proximity is maintained with this parameter, but the choice of Availability Zone is not. The group applies only to requests for Spot Instances of the same instance type. Any additional Spot Instance requests that are specified with the same Availability Zone group name are launched in that same Availability Zone, as long as at least one instance from the group is still active. If there is no active instance running in the Availability Zone group that you specify for a new Spot Instance request (all instances are terminated, the request is expired, or the maximum price you specified falls below current Spot price), then Amazon EC2 launches the instance in any Availability Zone where the constraint can be met. Consequently, the subsequent set of Spot Instances could be placed in a different zone from the original request, even if you specified the same Availability Zone group. Default: Instances are launched in any available Availability Zone.
    ///   - blockDurationMinutes: Deprecated.
    ///   - clientToken: Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request. For more information, see Ensuring idempotency in Amazon EC2 API requests in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.
    ///   - dryRun: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
    ///   - instanceCount: The maximum number of Spot Instances to launch. Default: 1
    ///   - instanceInterruptionBehavior: The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. The default is terminate.
    ///   - launchGroup: The instance launch group. Launch groups are Spot Instances that launch together and terminate together. Default: Instances are launched and terminated individually
    ///   - launchSpecification: The launch specification.
    ///   - spotPrice: The maximum price per unit hour that you are willing to pay for a Spot Instance. We do not recommend  using this parameter because it can lead to increased interruptions. If you do not specify this parameter, you will pay the current Spot price.  If you specify a maximum price, your instances will be interrupted more frequently than if you do not specify this parameter.
    ///   - tagSpecifications: The key-value pair for tagging the Spot Instance request on creation. The value for ResourceType must be spot-instances-request, otherwise the Spot Instance request fails. To tag the Spot Instance request after it has been created, see CreateTags.
    ///   - type: The Spot Instance request type. Default: one-time
    ///   - validFrom: The start date of the request. If this is a one-time request, the request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until all instances launch, the request expires, or the request is canceled. If the request is persistent, the request becomes active at this date and time and remains active until it expires or is canceled. The specified start date and time cannot be equal to the current date and time. You must specify a start date and time that occurs after the current date and time.
    ///   - validUntil: The end date of the request, in UTC format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ).   For a persistent request, the request remains active until the ValidUntil date and time is reached. Otherwise, the request remains active until you cancel it.    For a one-time request, the request remains active until all instances launch, the request is canceled, or the ValidUntil date and time is reached. By default, the request is valid for 7 days from the date the request was created.

The report is saved to your specified S3 bucket, using the following path structure (with the italicized placeholders representing your specific values):  s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/your-optional-s3-prefix/ec2_targetId_reportId_yyyyMMddThhmmZ.csv   Prerequisites for generating a report    The StartDeclarativePoliciesReport API can only be called by the management account or delegated administrators for the organization.   An S3 bucket must be available before generating the report (you can create a new one or use an existing one), it must be in the same Region where the report generation request is made, and it must have an appropriate bucket policy. For a sample S3 policy, see Sample Amazon S3 policy under .   Trusted access must be enabled for the service for which the declarative policy will enforce a baseline configuration. If you use the Amazon Web Services Organizations console, this is done automatically when you enable declarative policies. The API uses the following service principal to identify the EC2 service: ec2.amazonaws.com. For more information on how to enable trusted access with the Amazon Web Services CLI and Amazon Web Services SDKs, see Using Organizations with other Amazon Web Services services in the Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide.   Only one report per organization can be generated at a time. Attempting to generate a report while another is in progress will result in an error.   For more information, including the required IAM permissions to run this API, see Generating the account status report for declarative policies in the Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide.

The report provides the current status of all attributes supported by declarative policies for the accounts within the specified scope. The scope is determined by the specified TargetId, which can represent an individual account, or all the accounts that fall under the specified organizational unit (OU) or root (the entire Amazon Web Services Organization). The report is saved to your specified S3 bucket, using the following path structure (with the italicized placeholders representing your specific values):  s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/your-optional-s3-prefix/ec2_targetId_reportId_yyyyMMddThhmmZ.csv   Prerequisites for generating a report    The StartDeclarativePoliciesReport API can only be called by the management account or delegated administrators for the organization.   An S3 bucket must be available before generating the report (you can create a new one or use an existing one), it must be in the same Region where the report generation request is made, and it must have an appropriate bucket policy. For a sample S3 policy, see Sample Amazon S3 policy under .   Trusted access must be enabled for the service for which the declarative policy will enforce a baseline configuration. If you use the Amazon Web Services Organizations console, this is done automatically when you enable declarative policies. The API uses the following service principal to identify the EC2 service: ec2.amazonaws.com. For more information on how to enable trusted access with the Amazon Web Services CLI and Amazon Web Services SDKs, see Using Organizations with other Amazon Web Services services in the Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide.   Only one report per organization can be generated at a time. Attempting to generate a report while another is in progress will result in an error.   For more information, including the required IAM permissions to run this API, see Generating the account status report for declarative policies in the Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide.

    ///   - dryRun: Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request,  and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation.  Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
    ///   - filters: The filters.    availability-zone - The Availability Zone for the subnet. You can also use availabilityZone as the filter name.    availability-zone-id - The ID of the Availability Zone for the subnet. You can also use availabilityZoneId as the filter name.    available-ip-address-count - The number of IPv4 addresses in the subnet that are available.    cidr-block - The IPv4 CIDR block of the subnet. The CIDR block you specify must exactly match the subnet's CIDR block for information to be returned for the subnet. You can also use cidr or cidrBlock as the filter names.    customer-owned-ipv4-pool - The customer-owned IPv4 address pool associated with the subnet.    default-for-az - Indicates whether this is the default subnet for the Availability Zone (true | false). You can also use defaultForAz as the filter name.    enable-dns64 - Indicates whether DNS queries made to the Amazon-provided DNS Resolver in this subnet should return synthetic IPv6 addresses for IPv4-only destinations.    enable-lni-at-device-index - Indicates the device position for local network interfaces in this subnet. For example, 1 indicates local network interfaces in this subnet are the secondary network interface (eth1).     ipv6-cidr-block-association.ipv6-cidr-block - An IPv6 CIDR block associated with the subnet.    ipv6-cidr-block-association.association-id - An association ID for an IPv6 CIDR block associated with the subnet.    ipv6-cidr-block-association.state - The state of an IPv6 CIDR block associated with the subnet.    ipv6-native - Indicates whether this is an IPv6 only subnet (true | false).    map-customer-owned-ip-on-launch - Indicates whether a network interface created in this subnet (including a network interface created by RunInstances) receives a customer-owned IPv4 address.    map-public-ip-on-launch - Indicates whether instances launched in this subnet receive a public IPv4 address.    outpost-arn - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Outpost.    owner-id - The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the subnet.    private-dns-name-options-on-launch.hostname-type - The type of hostname to assign to instances in the subnet at launch. For IPv4-only and dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) subnets, an instance DNS name can be based on the instance IPv4 address (ip-name) or the instance ID (resource-name). For IPv6 only subnets, an instance DNS name must be based on the instance ID (resource-name).    private-dns-name-options-on-launch.enable-resource-name-dns-a-record - Indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames with DNS A records.    private-dns-name-options-on-launch.enable-resource-name-dns-aaaa-record - Indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames with DNS AAAA records.    state - The state of the subnet (pending | available).    subnet-arn - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the subnet.    subnet-id - The ID of the subnet.    tag - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Use the tag key in the filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For example, to find all resources that have a tag with the key Owner and the value TeamA, specify tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. Use this filter to find all resources assigned a tag with a specific key, regardless of the tag value.    vpc-id - The ID of the VPC for the subnet.
