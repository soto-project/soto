/// Service object for interacting with AWS Lightsail service.
///
/// Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) for developers who need to build websites or web applications. It includes everything you need to launch your project quickly - instances (virtual private servers), container services, storage buckets, managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP addresses, load balancers, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management of registered domains, and resource snapshots (backups) - for a low, predictable monthly price. You can manage your Lightsail resources using the Lightsail console, Lightsail API, Command Line Interface (CLI), or SDKs. For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide. This API Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the Lightsail service. For more information about the supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Lightsail service, see Amazon Lightsail Endpoints and Quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

    ///   - deployment: An object that describes a deployment for the container service. A deployment specifies the containers that will be launched on the container service and their settings, such as the ports to open, the environment variables to apply, and the launch command to run. It also specifies the container that will serve as the public endpoint of the deployment and its settings, such as the HTTP or HTTPS port to use, and the health check configuration.
    ///   - power: The power specification for the container service. The power specifies the amount of memory, vCPUs, and base monthly cost of each node of the container service. The power and scale of a container service makes up its configured capacity. To determine the monthly price of your container service, multiply the base price of the power with the scale (the number of nodes) of the service. Use the GetContainerServicePowers action to get a list of power options that you can specify using this parameter, and their base monthly cost.
    ///   - privateRegistryAccess: An object to describe the configuration for the container service to access private container image repositories, such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) private repositories. For more information, see Configuring access to an Amazon ECR private repository for an Amazon Lightsail container service in the Amazon Lightsail Developer Guide.
    ///   - publicDomainNames: The public domain names to use with the container service, such as example.com and www.example.com. You can specify up to four public domain names for a container service. The domain names that you specify are used when you create a deployment with a container configured as the public endpoint of your container service. If you don't specify public domain names, then you can use the default domain of the container service.  You must create and validate an SSL/TLS certificate before you can use public domain names with your container service. Use the CreateCertificate action to create a certificate for the public domain names you want to use with your container service.  You can specify public domain names using a string to array map as shown in the example later on this page.
    ///   - scale: The scale specification for the container service. The scale specifies the allocated compute nodes of the container service. The power and scale of a container service makes up its configured capacity. To determine the monthly price of your container service, multiply the base price of the power with the scale (the number of nodes) of the service.
    ///   - serviceName: The name for the container service. The name that you specify for your container service will make up part of its default domain. The default domain of a container service is typically https://...cs.amazonlightsail.com. If the name of your container service is container-service-1, and it's located in the US East (Ohio) Amazon Web Services Region (us-east-2), then the domain for your container service will be like the following example: https://container-service-1.ur4EXAMPLE2uq.us-east-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com  The following are the requirements for container service names:   Must be unique within each Amazon Web Services Region in your Lightsail account.

You can take a snapshot of an attached disk that is in use; however, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your disk at the time the snapshot command is issued. This may exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the disk long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. Nevertheless, if you cannot pause all file writes to the disk, you should unmount the disk from within the Lightsail instance, issue the create disk snapshot command, and then remount the disk to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your disk while the snapshot status is pending. You can also use this operation to create a snapshot of an instance's system volume. You might want to do this, for example, to recover data from the system volume of a botched instance or to create a backup of the system volume like you would for a block storage disk. To create a snapshot of a system volume, just define the instance name parameter when issuing the snapshot command, and a snapshot of the defined instance's system volume will be created. After the snapshot is available, you can create a block storage disk from the snapshot and attach it to a running instance to access the data on the disk.

Valid instance metric names are listed below, along with the most useful statistics to include in your request, and the published unit value.     BurstCapacityPercentage - The percentage of CPU performance available for your instance to burst above its baseline. Your instance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst capacity stops accruing when your instance's BurstCapacityPercentage reaches 100%. For more information, see Viewing instance burst capacity in Amazon Lightsail.  Statistics: The most useful statistics are Maximum and Average.  Unit: The published unit is Percent.     BurstCapacityTime - The available amount of time for your instance to burst at 100% CPU utilization. Your instance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst capacity time stops accruing when your instance's BurstCapacityPercentage metric reaches 100%. Burst capacity time is consumed at the full rate only when your instance operates at 100% CPU utilization. For example, if your instance operates at 50% CPU utilization in the burstable zone for a 5-minute period, then it consumes CPU burst capacity minutes at a 50% rate in that period. Your instance consumed 2 minutes and 30 seconds of CPU burst capacity minutes in the 5-minute period. For more information, see Viewing instance burst capacity in Amazon Lightsail.  Statistics: The most useful statistics are Maximum and Average.  Unit: The published unit is Seconds.     CPUUtilization - The percentage of allocated compute units that are currently in use on the instance. This metric identifies the processing power to run the applications on the instance. Tools in your operating system can show a lower percentage than Lightsail when the instance is not allocated a full processor core.  Statistics: The most useful statistics are Maximum and Average.  Unit: The published unit is Percent.     NetworkIn - The number of bytes received on all network interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of incoming network traffic to the instance. The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period. Because this metric is reported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by 300 to find Bytes/second.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Bytes.     NetworkOut - The number of bytes sent out on all network interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of outgoing network traffic from the instance.

    ///   - notificationEnabled: Indicates whether the alarm is enabled. Notifications are enabled by default if you don't specify this parameter.
    ///   - notificationTriggers: The alarm states that trigger a notification. An alarm has the following possible states:    ALARM - The metric is outside of the defined threshold.    INSUFFICIENT_DATA - The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state.    OK - The metric is within the defined threshold.   When you specify a notification trigger, the ALARM state must be specified. The INSUFFICIENT_DATA and OK states can be specified in addition to the ALARM state.   If you specify OK as an alarm trigger, a notification is sent when the alarm switches from an ALARM or INSUFFICIENT_DATA alarm state to an OK state. This can be thought of as an all clear alarm notification.   If you specify INSUFFICIENT_DATA as the alarm trigger, a notification is sent when the alarm switches from an OK or ALARM alarm state to an INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.   The notification trigger defaults to ALARM if you don't specify this parameter.

An alarm can treat missing data in the following ways:    breaching - Assume the missing data is not within the threshold. Missing data counts towards the number of times the metric is not within the threshold.    notBreaching - Assume the missing data is within the threshold. Missing data does not count towards the number of times the metric is not within the threshold.    ignore - Ignore the missing data. Maintains the current alarm state.    missing - Missing data is treated as missing.   If treatMissingData is not specified, the default behavior of missing is used.
