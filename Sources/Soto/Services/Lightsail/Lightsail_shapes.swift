The following failure reasons are possible:     NO_AVAILABLE_CONTACTS - This failure applies to email validation, which is not available for Lightsail certificates.     ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED - Lightsail requires additional information to process this certificate request. This can happen as a fraud-protection measure, such as when the domain ranks within the Alexa top 1000 websites. To provide the required information, use the Amazon Web Services Support Center to contact Amazon Web Services Support.  You cannot request a certificate for Amazon-owned domain names such as those ending in amazonaws.com, cloudfront.net, or elasticbeanstalk.com.      DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED - One or more of the domain names in the certificate request was reported as an unsafe domain by VirusTotal. To correct the problem, search for your domain name on the VirusTotal website. If your domain is reported as suspicious, see Google Help for Hacked Websites to learn what you can do. If you believe that the result is a false positive, notify the organization that is reporting the domain. VirusTotal is an aggregate of several antivirus and URL scanners and cannot remove your domain from a block list itself. After you correct the problem and the VirusTotal registry has been updated, request a new certificate. If you see this error and your domain is not included in the VirusTotal list, visit the Amazon Web Services Support Center and create a case.     INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN - One or more of the domain names in the certificate request is not valid. Typically, this is because a domain name in the request is not a valid top-level domain. Try to request a certificate again, correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request, and ensure that all domain names in the request are for valid top-level domains. For example, you cannot request a certificate for example.invalidpublicdomain because invalidpublicdomain is not a valid top-level domain.     OTHER - Typically, this failure occurs when there is a typographical error in one or more of the domain names in the certificate request. Try to request a certificate again, correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request.

Valid instance metric names are listed below, along with the most useful statistics to include in your request, and the published unit value.     BurstCapacityPercentage - The percentage of CPU performance available for your instance to burst above its baseline. Your instance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst capacity stops accruing when your instance's BurstCapacityPercentage reaches 100%. For more information, see Viewing instance burst capacity in Amazon Lightsail.  Statistics: The most useful statistics are Maximum and Average.  Unit: The published unit is Percent.     BurstCapacityTime - The available amount of time for your instance to burst at 100% CPU utilization. Your instance continuously accrues and consumes burst capacity. Burst capacity time stops accruing when your instance's BurstCapacityPercentage metric reaches 100%. Burst capacity time is consumed at the full rate only when your instance operates at 100% CPU utilization. For example, if your instance operates at 50% CPU utilization in the burstable zone for a 5-minute period, then it consumes CPU burst capacity minutes at a 50% rate in that period. Your instance consumed 2 minutes and 30 seconds of CPU burst capacity minutes in the 5-minute period. For more information, see Viewing instance burst capacity in Amazon Lightsail.  Statistics: The most useful statistics are Maximum and Average.  Unit: The published unit is Seconds.     CPUUtilization - The percentage of allocated compute units that are currently in use on the instance. This metric identifies the processing power to run the applications on the instance. Tools in your operating system can show a lower percentage than Lightsail when the instance is not allocated a full processor core.  Statistics: The most useful statistics are Maximum and Average.  Unit: The published unit is Percent.     NetworkIn - The number of bytes received on all network interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of incoming network traffic to the instance. The number reported is the number of bytes received during the period. Because this metric is reported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by 300 to find Bytes/second.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Bytes.     NetworkOut - The number of bytes sent out on all network interfaces by the instance. This metric identifies the volume of outgoing network traffic from the instance. The number reported is the number of bytes sent during the period. Because this metric is reported in 5-minute intervals, divide the reported number by 300 to find Bytes/second.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Bytes.     StatusCheckFailed - Reports whether the instance passed or failed both the instance status check and the system status check. This metric can be either 0 (passed) or 1 (failed). This metric data is available in 1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Count.     StatusCheckFailed_Instance - Reports whether the instance passed or failed the instance status check. This metric can be either 0 (passed) or 1 (failed). This metric data is available in 1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Count.     StatusCheckFailed_System - Reports whether the instance passed or failed the system status check. This metric can be either 0 (passed) or 1 (failed). This metric data is available in 1-minute (60 seconds) granularity.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Count.     MetadataNoToken - Reports the number of times that the instance metadata service was successfully accessed without a token. This metric determines if there are any processes accessing instance metadata by using Instance Metadata Service Version 1, which doesn't use a token. If all requests use token-backed sessions, such as Instance Metadata Service Version 2, then the value is 0.  Statistics: The most useful statistic is Sum.  Unit: The published unit is Count.

The following failure reasons are possible:     NO_AVAILABLE_CONTACTS - This failure applies to email validation, which is not available for Lightsail certificates.     ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED - Lightsail requires additional information to process this certificate request. This can happen as a fraud-protection measure, such as when the domain ranks within the Alexa top 1000 websites. To provide the required information, use the AWS Support Center to contact AWS Support.  You cannot request a certificate for Amazon-owned domain names such as those ending in amazonaws.com, cloudfront.net, or elasticbeanstalk.com.      DOMAIN_NOT_ALLOWED - One or more of the domain names in the certificate request was reported as an unsafe domain by VirusTotal. To correct the problem, search for your domain name on the VirusTotal website. If your domain is reported as suspicious, see Google Help for Hacked Websites to learn what you can do. If you believe that the result is a false positive, notify the organization that is reporting the domain. VirusTotal is an aggregate of several antivirus and URL scanners and cannot remove your domain from a block list itself. After you correct the problem and the VirusTotal registry has been updated, request a new certificate. If you see this error and your domain is not included in the VirusTotal list, visit the AWS Support Center and create a case.     INVALID_PUBLIC_DOMAIN - One or more of the domain names in the certificate request is not valid. Typically, this is because a domain name in the request is not a valid top-level domain. Try to request a certificate again, correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request, and ensure that all domain names in the request are for valid top-level domains. For example, you cannot request a certificate for example.invalidpublicdomain because invalidpublicdomain is not a valid top-level domain.     OTHER - Typically, this failure occurs when there is a typographical error in one or more of the domain names in the certificate request. Try to request a certificate again, correcting any spelling errors or typos that were in the failed request.

For more general information, see Transport layer on Wikipedia.    udp - With User Datagram Protocol (UDP), computer applications can send messages (or datagrams) to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

Applications that don't require reliable data stream service can use UDP, which provides a connectionless datagram service that emphasizes reduced latency over reliability.
