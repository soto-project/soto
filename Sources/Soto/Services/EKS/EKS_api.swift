/// Service object for interacting with AWS EKS service.

/// Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services without needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.  Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification required.

The control plane runs in an account managed by Amazon Web Services, and the Kubernetes API is exposed by the Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single tenant and unique. It runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances. The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example, to support kubectl exec, logs, and proxy data flows). Amazon EKS nodes run in your Amazon Web Services account and connect to your cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster. In most cases, it takes several minutes to create a cluster. After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API server and launch nodes into your cluster. For more information, see Managing Cluster Authentication and Launching Amazon EKS nodes in the Amazon EKS User Guide.

The Fargate profile allows an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate and specify which pods run on which Fargate profile. This declaration is done through the profile’s selectors. Each profile can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate. When you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use with the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the cluster's Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization so that the kubelet that is running on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your cluster as a node. The pod execution role also provides IAM permissions to the Fargate infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information, see Pod Execution Role in the Amazon EKS User Guide. Fargate profiles are immutable. However, you can create a new updated profile to replace an existing profile and then delete the original after the updated profile has finished creating. If any Fargate profiles in a cluster are in the DELETING status, you must wait for that Fargate profile to finish deleting before you can create any other profiles in that cluster. For more information, see Fargate Profile in the Amazon EKS User Guide.
