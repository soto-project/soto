/// Service object for interacting with AWS EKS service.
///
/// Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services without needing to setup or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Amazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification required.

    /// Parameters:
    ///   - clientRequestToken: A unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure
    ///   - clusterName: The name of your cluster.
    ///   - kubernetesGroups: The value for name that you've specified for kind: Group as a subject in a Kubernetes RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding object. Amazon EKS doesn't confirm that the value for name exists in any bindings on your cluster. You can specify one or more names. Kubernetes authorizes the principalArn of the access entry to access any cluster objects that you've specified in a Kubernetes Role or ClusterRole object that is also specified in a binding's roleRef. For more information about creating Kubernetes RoleBinding, ClusterRoleBinding, Role, or ClusterRole objects, see Using RBAC Authorization in the Kubernetes documentation. If you want Amazon EKS to authorize the principalArn (instead of, or in addition to Kubernetes authorizing the principalArn), you can associate one or more access policies to the access entry using AssociateAccessPolicy. If you associate any access policies, the principalARN has all permissions assigned in the associated access policies and all permissions in any Kubernetes Role or ClusterRole objects that the group names are bound to.
    ///   - principalArn: The ARN of the IAM principal for the AccessEntry. You can specify one ARN for each access entry. You can't specify the same ARN in more than one access entry. This value can't be changed after access entry creation. The valid principals differ depending on the type of the access entry in the type field. For STANDARD access entries, you can use every IAM principal type. For nodes (EC2 (for EKS Auto Mode), EC2_LINUX, EC2_WINDOWS, FARGATE_LINUX, and HYBRID_LINUX), the only valid ARN is IAM roles.  You can't use the STS session principal type with access entries because this is a temporary principal for each session and not a permanent identity that can be assigned permissions.  IAM best practices recommend using IAM roles with temporary credentials, rather than IAM users with long-term credentials.
    ///   - tags: Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.
    ///   - type: The type of the new access entry. Valid values are STANDARD, FARGATE_LINUX, EC2_LINUX, EC2_WINDOWS, EC2 (for EKS Auto Mode), HYBRID_LINUX, and HYPERPOD_LINUX.  If the principalArn is for an IAM role that's used for self-managed Amazon EC2 nodes, specify EC2_LINUX or EC2_WINDOWS. Amazon EKS grants the necessary permissions to the node for you. If the principalArn is for any other purpose, specify STANDARD. If you don't specify a value, Amazon EKS sets the value to STANDARD. If you have the access mode of the cluster set to API_AND_CONFIG_MAP, it's unnecessary to create access entries for IAM roles used with Fargate profiles or managed Amazon EC2 nodes, because Amazon EKS creates entries in the aws-auth ConfigMap for the roles. You can't change this value once you've created the access entry. If you set the value to EC2_LINUX or EC2_WINDOWS, you can't specify values for kubernetesGroups, or associate an AccessPolicy to the access entry.
    ///   - username: The username to authenticate to Kubernetes with. We recommend not specifying a username and letting Amazon EKS specify it for you.

Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single tenant and unique. It runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances. The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example, to support kubectl exec, logs, and proxy data flows). Amazon EKS nodes run in your Amazon Web Services account and connect to your cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster. You can use the endpointPublicAccess and endpointPrivateAccess parameters to enable or disable public and private access to your cluster's Kubernetes API server endpoint. By default, public access is enabled, and private access is disabled. For more information, see Amazon EKS Cluster Endpoint Access Control in the  Amazon EKS User Guide .  You can use the logging parameter to enable or disable exporting the Kubernetes control plane logs for your cluster to CloudWatch Logs. By default, cluster control plane logs aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs. For more information, see Amazon EKS Cluster Control Plane Logs in the  Amazon EKS User Guide .  CloudWatch Logs ingestion, archive storage, and data scanning rates apply to exported control plane logs. For more information, see CloudWatch Pricing.  In most cases, it takes several minutes to create a cluster. After you create an Amazon EKS cluster, you must configure your Kubernetes tooling to communicate with the API server and launch nodes into your cluster.

The control plane runs in an account managed by Amazon Web Services, and the Kubernetes API is exposed by the Amazon EKS API server endpoint. Each Amazon EKS cluster control plane is single tenant and unique. It runs on its own set of Amazon EC2 instances. The cluster control plane is provisioned across multiple Availability Zones and fronted by an Elastic Load Balancing Network Load Balancer. Amazon EKS also provisions elastic network interfaces in your VPC subnets to provide connectivity from the control plane instances to the nodes (for example, to support kubectl exec, logs, and proxy data flows). Amazon EKS nodes run in your Amazon Web Services account and connect to your cluster's control plane over the Kubernetes API server endpoint and a certificate file that is created for your cluster.

This object isn't available for creating Amazon EKS clusters on the Amazon Web Services cloud.
    ///   - remoteNetworkConfig: The configuration in the cluster for EKS Hybrid Nodes. You can't change or update this configuration after the cluster is created.
    ///   - resourcesVpcConfig: The VPC configuration that's used by the cluster control plane. Amazon EKS VPC resources have specific requirements to work properly with Kubernetes. For more information, see Cluster VPC Considerations and Cluster Security Group Considerations in the Amazon EKS User Guide. You must specify at least two subnets. You can specify up to five security groups. However, we recommend that you use a dedicated security group for your cluster control plane.
    ///   - roleArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that provides permissions for the Kubernetes control plane to make calls to Amazon Web Services API operations on your behalf. For more information, see Amazon EKS Service IAM Role in the  Amazon EKS User Guide .

Zonal shift is a feature of Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC). ARC zonal shift is designed to be a temporary measure that allows you to move traffic for a resource away from an impaired AZ until the zonal shift expires or you cancel it. You can extend the zonal shift if necessary. You can start a zonal shift for an Amazon EKS cluster, or you can allow Amazon Web Services to do it for you by enabling zonal autoshift. This shift updates the flow of east-to-west network traffic in your cluster to only consider network endpoints for Pods running on worker nodes in healthy AZs. Additionally, any ALB or NLB handling ingress traffic for applications in your Amazon EKS cluster will automatically route traffic to targets in the healthy AZs.

Each profile can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate.

Use EKS Pod Identity to give temporary IAM credentials to pods and the credentials are rotated automatically. Amazon EKS Pod Identity associations provide the ability to manage credentials for your applications, similar to the way that Amazon EC2 instance profiles provide credentials to Amazon EC2 instances. If a pod uses a service account that has an association, Amazon EKS sets environment variables in the containers of the pod. The environment variables configure the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including the Command Line Interface, to use the EKS Pod Identity credentials. Pod Identity is a simpler method than IAM roles for service accounts, as this method doesn't use OIDC identity providers. Additionally, you can configure a role for Pod Identity once, and reuse it across clusters.

Zonal shift is a feature of Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC).

You can extend the zonal shift if necessary. You can start a zonal shift for an EKS cluster, or you can allow Amazon Web Services to do it for you by enabling zonal autoshift. This shift updates the flow of east-to-west network traffic in your cluster to only consider network endpoints for Pods running on worker nodes in healthy AZs. Additionally, any ALB or NLB handling ingress traffic for applications in your EKS cluster will automatically route traffic to targets in the healthy AZs.
