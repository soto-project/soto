Also, you must make the API calls while in your home region.

    /// Associates a created artifact of an AWS cloud resource, the target receiving the migration, with the migration task performed by a migration tool. This API has the following traits:   Migration tools can call the AssociateCreatedArtifact operation to indicate which AWS artifact is associated with a migration task.   The created artifact name must be provided in ARN (Amazon Resource Name) format which will contain information about type and region; for example: arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:488216288981:image/ami-6d0ba87b.   Examples of the AWS resource behind the created artifact are, AMI's, EC2 instance, or DMS endpoint, etc.

This API has the following traits:   The only parameter needed for DeleteProgressUpdateStream is the stream name (same as a CreateProgressUpdateStream call).   The call will return, and a background process will asynchronously delete the stream and all of its resources (tasks, associated resources, resource attributes, created artifacts).   If the stream takes time to be deleted, it might still show up on a ListProgressUpdateStreams call.    CreateProgressUpdateStream, ImportMigrationTask, NotifyMigrationTaskState, and all Associate[*] APIs related to the tasks belonging to the stream will throw "InvalidInputException" if the stream of the same name is in the process of being deleted.   Once the stream and all of its resources are deleted, CreateProgressUpdateStream for a stream of the same name will succeed, and that stream will be an entirely new logical resource (without any resources associated with the old stream).
