    ///   - autoApprovalDelayInSeconds:  The number of seconds after an assignment for the HIT has been submitted, after which the assignment is considered Approved automatically unless the Requester explicitly rejects it.

    ///   - hitTypeId: The HIT type ID you want to create this HIT with.
    ///   - lifetimeInSeconds:  An amount of time, in seconds, after which the HIT is no longer available for users to accept. After the lifetime of the HIT elapses, the HIT no longer appears in HIT searches, even if not all of the assignments for the HIT have been accepted.
