Amazon Mechanical Turk fees are debited.     If the Requester's account does not have adequate funds for these payments, the call to ApproveAssignment returns an exception, and the approval is not processed. You can include an optional feedback message with the approval, which the Worker can see in the Status section of the web site.

Note: AssociateQualificationWithWorker does not affect any pending Qualification requests for the Qualification by the Worker. If you assign a Qualification to a Worker, then later grant a Qualification request made by the Worker, the granting of the request may modify the Qualification score.

If you provide an updated Test but no AnswerKey, the new test will not have an answer key. Requests for such Qualifications must be granted manually.   You can also update the AutoGranted and AutoGrantedValue attributes of the Qualification type.
    public func updateQualificationType(_ input: UpdateQualificationTypeRequest, logger: Logger = AWSClient.loggingDisabled, on eventLoop: EventLoop? = nil) async throws -> UpdateQualificationTypeResponse {
        return try await self.client.execute(operation: "UpdateQualificationType", path: "/", httpMethod: .POST, serviceConfig: self.config, input: input, logger: logger, on: eventLoop)
    }
}
