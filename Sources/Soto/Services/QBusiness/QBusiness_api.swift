/// Service object for interacting with AWS QBusiness service.
///
/// This is the Amazon Q Business API Reference. Amazon Q Business is a fully managed, generative-AI powered enterprise chat assistant that you can deploy within your organization. Amazon Q Business enhances employee productivity by supporting key tasks such as question-answering, knowledge discovery, writing email messages, summarizing text, drafting document outlines, and brainstorming ideas. Users ask questions of Amazon Q Business and get answers that are presented in a conversational manner. For an introduction to the service, see the  Amazon Q Business User Guide . For an overview of the Amazon Q Business APIs, see Overview of Amazon Q Business API operations. For information about the IAM access control permissions you need to use this API, see IAM roles for Amazon Q Business in the Amazon Q Business User Guide. The following resources provide additional information about using the Amazon Q Business API:     Setting up for Amazon Q Business       Amazon Q Business CLI Reference       Amazon Web Services General Reference
