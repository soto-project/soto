For more information, see IoT Greengrass component recipe reference in the IoT Greengrass V2 Developer Guide. To create a component from a recipe, specify inlineRecipe when you call this operation.

    ///  Retrieves a paginated list of the components that a Greengrass core device runs. By default, this list doesn't include components that are deployed as dependencies of other components. To include dependencies in the response, set the topologyFilter parameter to ALL.  IoT Greengrass relies on individual devices to send status updates to the Amazon Web Services Cloud. If the IoT Greengrass Core software isn't running on the device, or if device isn't connected to the Amazon Web Services Cloud, then the reported status of that device might not reflect its current status. The status timestamp indicates when the device status was last updated. Core devices send status updates at the following times:   When the IoT Greengrass Core software starts   When the core device receives a deployment from the Amazon Web Services Cloud   When the status of any component on the core device becomes BROKEN    At a regular interval that you can configure, which defaults to 24 hours   For IoT Greengrass Core v2.7.0, the core device sends status updates upon local deployment and cloud deployment
