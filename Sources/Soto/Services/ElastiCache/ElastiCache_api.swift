/// Service object for interacting with AWS ElastiCache service.
///
/// Amazon ElastiCache Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a distributed cache in the cloud. With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of a high-performance, in-memory cache with less of the administrative burden involved in launching and managing a distributed cache. The service makes setup, scaling, and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-managed cache deployment. In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers get enhanced visibility into the key performance statistics associated with their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.

    ///   - cacheSubnetGroupName: The name of the subnet group to be used for the cluster. Use this parameter only when you are creating a cluster in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).  If you're going to launch your cluster in an Amazon VPC, you need to create a subnet group before you start creating a cluster. For more information, see Subnets and Subnet Groups.
    ///   - engine: The name of the cache engine to be used for this cluster. Valid values for this parameter are: memcached | redis
    ///   - engineVersion: The version number of the cache engine to be used for this cluster. To view the supported cache engine versions, use the DescribeCacheEngineVersions operation.  Important: You can upgrade to a newer engine version (see Selecting a Cache Engine and Version), but you cannot downgrade to an earlier engine version. If you want to use an earlier engine version, you must delete the existing cluster or replication group and create it anew with the earlier engine version.
    ///   - ipDiscovery: The network type you choose when modifying a cluster, either ipv4 | ipv6. IPv6 is supported for workloads using Valkey 7.2 and above, Redis OSS engine version 6.2 to 7.1 and Memcached engine version 1.6.6 and above on all instances built on the Nitro system.
    ///   - logDeliveryConfigurations: Specifies the destination, format and type of the logs.

    ///   - outpostMode: Specifies whether the nodes in the cluster are created in a single outpost or across multiple outposts.
    ///   - port: The port number on which each of the cache nodes accepts connections.
    ///   - preferredAvailabilityZone: The EC2 Availability Zone in which the cluster is created. All nodes belonging to this cluster are placed in the preferred Availability Zone. If you want to create your nodes across multiple Availability Zones, use PreferredAvailabilityZones. Default: System chosen Availability Zone.
    ///   - preferredAvailabilityZones: A list of the Availability Zones in which cache nodes are created. The order of the zones in the list is not important. This option is only supported on Memcached.  If you are creating your cluster in an Amazon VPC (recommended) you can only locate nodes in Availability Zones that are associated with the subnets in the selected subnet group. The number of Availability Zones listed must equal the value of NumCacheNodes.  If you want all the nodes in the same Availability Zone, use PreferredAvailabilityZone instead, or repeat the Availability Zone multiple times in the list. Default: System chosen Availability Zones.
    ///   - preferredMaintenanceWindow: Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster is performed. It is specified as a range in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance window is a 60 minute period.

    ///   - preferredOutpostArns: The outpost ARNs in which the cache cluster is created.
    ///   - replicationGroupId: The ID of the replication group to which this cluster should belong. If this parameter is specified, the cluster is added to the specified replication group as a read replica; otherwise, the cluster is a standalone primary that is not part of any replication group. If the specified replication group is Multi-AZ enabled and the Availability Zone is not specified, the cluster is created in Availability Zones that provide the best spread of read replicas across Availability Zones.  This parameter is only valid if the Engine parameter is redis.
    ///   - securityGroupIds: One or more VPC security groups associated with the cluster. Use this parameter only when you are creating a cluster in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
    ///   - snapshotArns: A single-element string list containing an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies a Valkey or Redis OSS RDB snapshot file stored in Amazon S3. The snapshot file is used to populate the node group (shard). The Amazon S3 object name in the ARN cannot contain any commas.  This parameter is only valid if the Engine parameter is redis.  Example of an Amazon S3 ARN: arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket/snapshot1.rdb
    ///   - snapshotName: The name of a Valkey or Redis OSS snapshot from which to restore data into the new node group (shard). The snapshot status changes to restoring while the new node group (shard) is being created.  This parameter is only valid if the Engine parameter is redis.

Generally speaking, the current generation types provide more memory and computational power at lower cost when compared to their equivalent previous generation counterparts.   General purpose:   Current generation:   M7g node types: 					cache.m7g.large, 					cache.m7g.xlarge, 					cache.m7g.2xlarge, 					cache.m7g.4xlarge, 					cache.m7g.8xlarge, 					cache.m7g.12xlarge, 					cache.m7g.16xlarge   For region availability, see Supported Node Types    M6g node types (available only for Redis OSS engine version 5.0.6 onward and for Memcached engine version 1.5.16 onward):
    ///   - cacheParameterGroupName: The name of the parameter group to associate with this replication group. If this argument is omitted, the default cache parameter group for the specified engine is used. If you are running Valkey or Redis OSS version 3.2.4 or later, only one node group (shard), and want to use a default parameter group, we recommend that you specify the parameter group by name.    To create a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) replication group, use CacheParameterGroupName=default.redis3.2.   To create a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group, use CacheParameterGroupName=default.redis3.2.cluster.on.
    ///   - cacheSecurityGroupNames: A list of cache security group names to associate with this replication group.
    ///   - cacheSubnetGroupName: The name of the cache subnet group to be used for the replication group.  If you're going to launch your cluster in an Amazon VPC, you need to create a subnet group before you start creating a cluster. For more information, see Subnets and Subnet Groups.
    ///   - clusterMode: Enabled or Disabled. To modify cluster mode from Disabled to Enabled, you must first set the cluster mode to Compatible. Compatible mode allows your Valkey or Redis OSS clients to connect using both cluster mode enabled and cluster mode disabled. After you migrate all Valkey or Redis OSS  clients to use cluster mode enabled, you can then complete cluster mode configuration and set the cluster mode to Enabled.
    ///   - dataTieringEnabled: Enables data tiering. Data tiering is only supported for replication groups using the r6gd node type. This parameter must be set to true when using r6gd nodes. For more information, see Data tiering.
    ///   - engine: The name of the cache engine to be used for the clusters in this replication group. The value must be set to valkey or redis.
    ///   - engineVersion: The version number of the cache engine to be used for the clusters in this replication group. To view the supported cache engine versions, use the DescribeCacheEngineVersions operation.  Important: You can upgrade to a newer engine version (see Selecting a Cache Engine and Version) in the ElastiCache User Guide, but you cannot downgrade to an earlier engine version. If you want to use an earlier engine version, you must delete the existing cluster or replication group and create it anew with the earlier engine version.
    ///   - globalReplicationGroupId: The name of the Global datastore
    ///   - ipDiscovery: The network type you choose when creating a replication group, either ipv4 | ipv6. IPv6 is supported for workloads using Valkey 7.2 and above, Redis OSS engine version 6.2 to 7.1 or Memcached engine version 1.6.6 and above on all instances built on the Nitro system.

    ///   - nodeGroupConfiguration: A list of node group (shard) configuration options. Each node group (shard) configuration has the following members: PrimaryAvailabilityZone, ReplicaAvailabilityZones, ReplicaCount, and Slots. If you're creating a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) or a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group, you can use this parameter to individually configure each node group (shard), or you can omit this parameter. However, it is required when seeding a Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) cluster from a S3 rdb file. You must configure each node group (shard) using this parameter because you must specify the slots for each node group.
    ///   - notificationTopicArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to which notifications are sent.  The Amazon SNS topic owner must be the same as the cluster owner.
    ///   - numCacheClusters: The number of clusters this replication group initially has. This parameter is not used if there is more than one node group (shard). You should use ReplicasPerNodeGroup instead. If AutomaticFailoverEnabled is true, the value of this parameter must be at least 2. If AutomaticFailoverEnabled is false you can omit this parameter (it will default to 1), or you can explicitly set it to a value between 2 and 6. The maximum permitted value for NumCacheClusters is 6 (1 primary plus 5 replicas).
    ///   - numNodeGroups: An optional parameter that specifies the number of node groups (shards) for this Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group. For Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode disabled) either omit this parameter or set it to 1. Default: 1
    ///   - port: The port number on which each member of the replication group accepts connections.
    ///   - preferredCacheClusterAZs: A list of EC2 Availability Zones in which the replication group's clusters are created. The order of the Availability Zones in the list is the order in which clusters are allocated. The primary cluster is created in the first AZ in the list. This parameter is not used if there is more than one node group (shard). You should use NodeGroupConfiguration instead.  If you are creating your replication group in an Amazon VPC (recommended), you can only locate clusters in Availability Zones associated with the subnets in the selected subnet group. The number of Availability Zones listed must equal the value of NumCacheClusters.  Default: system chosen Availability Zones.
    ///   - preferredMaintenanceWindow: Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster is performed. It is specified as a range in the format ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance window is a 60 minute period. Valid values for ddd are:    sun     mon     tue     wed     thu     fri     sat    Example: sun:23:00-mon:01:30
    ///   - primaryClusterId: The identifier of the cluster that serves as the primary for this replication group. This cluster must already exist and have a status of available. This parameter is not required if NumCacheClusters, NumNodeGroups, or ReplicasPerNodeGroup is specified.
    ///   - replicasPerNodeGroup: An optional parameter that specifies the number of replica nodes in each node group (shard). Valid values are 0 to 5.
    ///   - replicationGroupDescription: A user-created description for the replication group.
    ///   - replicationGroupId: The replication group identifier. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string. Constraints:   A name must contain from 1 to 40 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.   The first character must be a letter.   A name cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

    ///   - snapshotArns: A list of Amazon Resource Names (ARN) that uniquely identify the Valkey or Redis OSS RDB snapshot files stored in Amazon S3. The snapshot files are used to populate the new replication group. The Amazon S3 object name in the ARN cannot contain any commas. The new replication group will have the number of node groups (console: shards) specified by the parameter NumNodeGroups or the number of node groups configured by NodeGroupConfiguration regardless of the number of ARNs specified here. Example of an Amazon S3 ARN: arn:aws:s3:::my_bucket/snapshot1.rdb
    ///   - snapshotName: The name of a snapshot from which to restore data into the new replication group. The snapshot status changes to restoring while the new replication group is being created.
    ///   - snapshotRetentionLimit: The number of days for which ElastiCache retains automatic snapshots before deleting them. For example, if you set SnapshotRetentionLimit to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is retained for 5 days before being deleted. Default: 0 (i.e., automatic backups are disabled for this cluster).
    ///   - snapshotWindow: The daily time range (in UTC) during which ElastiCache begins taking a daily snapshot of your node group (shard). Example: 05:00-09:00  If you do not specify this parameter, ElastiCache automatically chooses an appropriate time range.
    ///   - tags: A list of tags to be added to this resource. Tags are comma-separated key,value pairs (e.g. Key=myKey, Value=myKeyValue. You can include multiple tags as shown following: Key=myKey, Value=myKeyValue Key=mySecondKey, Value=mySecondKeyValue. Tags on replication groups will be replicated to all nodes.
    ///   - transitEncryptionEnabled: A flag that enables in-transit encryption when set to true. This parameter is valid only if the Engine parameter is redis, the EngineVersion parameter is 3.2.6, 4.x or later, and the cluster is being created in an Amazon VPC. If you enable in-transit encryption, you must also specify a value for CacheSubnetGroup.  Required: Only available when creating a replication group in an Amazon VPC using Redis OSS version 3.2.6, 4.x or later. Default: false   For HIPAA compliance, you must specify TransitEncryptionEnabled as true, an AuthToken, and a CacheSubnetGroup.
    ///   - transitEncryptionMode: A setting that allows you to migrate your clients to use in-transit encryption, with no downtime. When setting TransitEncryptionEnabled to true, you can set your TransitEncryptionMode to preferred in the same request, to allow both encrypted and unencrypted connections at the same time. Once you migrate all your Valkey or Redis OSS clients to use encrypted connections you can modify the value to required to allow encrypted connections only. Setting TransitEncryptionMode to required is a two-step process that requires you to first set the TransitEncryptionMode to preferred, after that you can set TransitEncryptionMode to required. This process will not trigger the replacement of the replication group.

Impact of new add/remove requests upon pending requests    Scenario-1   Pending Action: Delete   New Request: Delete   Result: The new delete, pending or immediate, replaces the pending delete.     Scenario-2   Pending Action: Delete   New Request: Create   Result: The new create, pending or immediate, replaces the pending delete.     Scenario-3   Pending Action: Create   New Request: Delete   Result: The new delete, pending or immediate, replaces the pending create.     Scenario-4   Pending Action: Create   New Request: Create   Result: The new create is added to the pending create.   Important: If the new create request is Apply Immediately - Yes, all creates are performed immediately. If the new create request is Apply Immediately - No, all creates are pending.
    ///   - notificationTopicArn: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to which notifications are sent.  The Amazon SNS topic owner must be same as the cluster owner.
    ///   - notificationTopicStatus: The status of the Amazon SNS notification topic. Notifications are sent only if the status is active. Valid values: active | inactive
    ///   - numCacheNodes: The number of cache nodes that the cluster should have. If the value for NumCacheNodes is greater than the sum of the number of current cache nodes and the number of cache nodes pending creation (which may be zero), more nodes are added. If the value is less than the number of existing cache nodes, nodes are removed. If the value is equal to the number of current cache nodes, any pending add or remove requests are canceled. If you are removing cache nodes, you must use the CacheNodeIdsToRemove parameter to provide the IDs of the specific cache nodes to remove. For clusters running Valkey or Redis OSS, this value must be 1. For clusters running Memcached, this value must be between 1 and 40.  Adding or removing Memcached cache nodes can be applied immediately or as a pending operation (see ApplyImmediately). A pending operation to modify the number of cache nodes in a cluster during its maintenance window, whether by adding or removing nodes in accordance with the scale out architecture, is not queued. The customer's latest request to add or remove nodes to the cluster overrides any previous pending operations to modify the number of cache nodes in the cluster. For example, a request to remove 2 nodes would override a previous pending operation to remove 3 nodes. Similarly, a request to add 2 nodes would override a previous pending operation to remove 3 nodes and vice versa. As Memcached cache nodes may now be provisioned in different Availability Zones with flexible cache node placement, a request to add nodes does not automatically override a previous pending operation to add nodes. The customer can modify the previous pending operation to add more nodes or explicitly cancel the pending request and retry the new request. To cancel pending operations to modify the number of cache nodes in a cluster, use the ModifyCacheCluster request and set NumCacheNodes equal to the number of cache nodes currently in the cluster.
    ///   - preferredMaintenanceWindow: Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster is performed.

This API is designed for testing the behavior of your application in case of ElastiCache failover. It is not designed to be an operational tool for initiating a failover to overcome a problem you may have with the cluster. Moreover, in certain conditions such as large-scale operational events, Amazon may block this API.   Note the following    A customer can use this operation to test automatic failover on up to 15 shards (called node groups in the ElastiCache API and Amazon CLI) in any rolling 24-hour period.   If calling this operation on shards in different clusters (called replication groups in the API and CLI), the calls can be made concurrently.    If calling this operation multiple times on different shards in the same Valkey or Redis OSS (cluster mode enabled) replication group, the first node replacement must complete before a subsequent call can be made.   To determine whether the node replacement is complete you can check Events using the Amazon ElastiCache console, the Amazon CLI, or the ElastiCache API. Look for the following automatic failover related events, listed here in order of occurrance:   Replication group message: Test Failover API called for node group     Cache cluster message: Failover from primary node to replica node  completed    Replication group message: Failover from primary node to replica node  completed    Cache cluster message: Recovering cache nodes     Cache cluster message: Finished recovery for cache nodes     For more information see:    Viewing ElastiCache Events in the ElastiCache User Guide     DescribeEvents in the ElastiCache API Reference     Also see, Testing Multi-AZ  in the ElastiCache User Guide.
