For a list of services with resources that support tagging using this operation, see Services that support the Resource Groups Tagging API. If the resource doesn't yet support this operation, the resource's service might support tagging using its own API operations. For more information, refer to the documentation for that service.   Each resource can have up to 50 tags. For other limits, see Tag Naming and Usage Conventions in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.    You can only tag resources that are located in the specified Amazon Web Services Region for the Amazon Web Services account.   To add tags to a resource, you need the necessary permissions for the service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions for adding tags. For more information, see the documentation for each service.    Do not store personally identifiable information (PII) or other confidential or sensitive information in tags. We use tags to provide you with billing and administration services. Tags are not intended to be used for private or sensitive data.   Minimum permissions  In addition to the tag:TagResources permission required by this operation, you must also have the tagging permission defined by the service that created the resource. For example, to tag an Amazon EC2 instance using the TagResources operation, you must have both of the following permissions:    tag:TagResource     ec2:CreateTags

For more information, see the documentation for the service whose resource you want to untag.   You can only tag resources that are located in the specified Amazon Web Services Region for the calling Amazon Web Services account.     Minimum permissions  In addition to the tag:UntagResources permission required by this operation, you must also have the remove tags permission defined by the service that created the resource.
