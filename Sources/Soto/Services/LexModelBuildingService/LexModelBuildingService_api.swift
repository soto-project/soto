    /// Parameters:
    ///   - abortStatement: When Amazon Lex can't understand the user's input in context, it tries to elicit the information a few times. After that, Amazon Lex sends the message defined in abortStatement to the user, and then cancels the conversation. To set the number of retries, use the valueElicitationPrompt field for the slot type.  For example, in a pizza ordering bot, Amazon Lex might ask a user "What type of crust would you like?" If the user's response is not one of the expected responses (for example, "thin crust, "deep dish," etc.), Amazon Lex tries to elicit a correct response a few more times.  For example, in a pizza ordering application, OrderPizza might be one of the intents. This intent might require the CrustType slot. You specify the valueElicitationPrompt field when you create the CrustType slot. If you have defined a fallback intent the cancel statement will not be sent to the user, the fallback intent is used instead. For more information, see  AMAZON.FallbackIntent.
    ///   - checksum: Identifies a specific revision of the $LATEST version. When you create a new bot, leave the checksum field blank. If you specify a checksum you get a BadRequestException exception. When you want to update a bot, set the checksum field to the checksum of the most recent revision of the $LATEST version. If you don't specify the  checksum field, or if the checksum does not match the $LATEST version, you get a PreconditionFailedException exception.
    ///   - childDirected: For each Amazon Lex bot created with the Amazon Lex Model Building Service, you must specify whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by specifying true or false in the childDirected field. By specifying true in the childDirected field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. By specifying false in the childDirected field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is not related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. You may not specify a default value for the childDirected field that does not accurately reflect whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. If your use of Amazon Lex relates to a website, program, or other application that is directed in whole or in part, to children under age 13, you must obtain any required verifiable parental consent under COPPA. For information regarding the use of Amazon Lex in connection with websites, programs, or other applications that are directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13, see the Amazon Lex FAQ.
    ///   - clarificationPrompt: When Amazon Lex doesn't understand the user's intent, it uses this message to get clarification. To specify how many times Amazon Lex should repeat the clarification prompt, use the maxAttempts field. If Amazon Lex still doesn't understand, it sends the message in the abortStatement field.  When you create a clarification prompt, make sure that it suggests the correct response from the user. for example, for a bot that orders pizza and drinks, you might create this clarification prompt: "What would you like to do? You can say 'Order a pizza' or 'Order a drink.'" If you have defined a fallback intent, it will be invoked if the clarification prompt is repeated the number of times defined in the maxAttempts field. For more information, see  AMAZON.FallbackIntent. If you don't define a clarification prompt, at runtime Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception in three cases:    Follow-up prompt - When the user responds to a follow-up prompt but does not provide an intent. For example, in response to a follow-up prompt that says "Would you like anything else today?" the user says "Yes." Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad Request exception because it does not have a clarification prompt to send to the user to get an intent.   Lambda function - When using a Lambda function, you return an ElicitIntent dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.   PutSession operation - When using the PutSession operation, you send an ElicitIntent dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clarification prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a 400 Bad Request exception.
    ///   - createVersion: When set to true a new numbered version of the bot is created. This is the same as calling the CreateBotVersion operation. If you don't specify createVersion, the default is false.
    ///   - description: A description of the bot.
    ///   - detectSentiment: When set to true user utterances are sent to Amazon Comprehend for sentiment analysis. If you don't specify detectSentiment, the default is false.
    ///   - enableModelImprovements: Set to true to enable access to natural language understanding improvements.  When you set the enableModelImprovements parameter to true you can use the nluIntentConfidenceThreshold parameter to configure confidence scores. For more information, see Confidence Scores. You can only set the enableModelImprovements parameter in certain Regions. If you set the parameter to true, your bot has access to accuracy improvements. The Regions where you can set the enableModelImprovements parameter to true are:   US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)   US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)   Asia Pacific (Sydney) (ap-southeast-2)   EU (Ireland) (eu-west-1)   In other Regions, the enableModelImprovements parameter is set to true by default. In these Regions setting the parameter to false throws a ValidationException exception.
    ///   - idleSessionTTLInSeconds: The maximum time in seconds that Amazon Lex retains the data gathered in a conversation. A user interaction session remains active for the amount of time specified. If no conversation occurs during this time, the session expires and Amazon Lex deletes any data provided before the timeout. For example, suppose that a user chooses the OrderPizza intent, but gets sidetracked halfway through placing an order. If the user doesn't complete the order within the specified time, Amazon Lex discards the slot information that it gathered, and the user must start over. If you don't include the idleSessionTTLInSeconds element in a PutBot operation request, Amazon Lex uses the default value. This is also true if the request replaces an existing bot. The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).
    ///   - intents: An array of Intent objects. Each intent represents a command that a user can express. For example, a pizza ordering bot might support an OrderPizza intent. For more information, see how-it-works.
    ///   - locale:  Specifies the target locale for the bot. Any intent used in the bot must be compatible with the locale of the bot.  The default is en-US.
    ///   - name: The name of the bot. The name is not case sensitive.
    ///   - nluIntentConfidenceThreshold: Determines the threshold where Amazon Lex will insert the AMAZON.FallbackIntent, AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent, or both when returning alternative intents in a PostContent or PostText response. AMAZON.FallbackIntent and AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent are only inserted if they are configured for the bot. You must set the enableModelImprovements parameter to true to use confidence scores in the following regions.   US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)   US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)   Asia Pacific (Sydney) (ap-southeast-2)   EU (Ireland) (eu-west-1)   In other Regions, the enableModelImprovements parameter is set to true by default. For example, suppose a bot is configured with the confidence threshold of 0.80 and the AMAZON.FallbackIntent. Amazon Lex returns three alternative intents with the following confidence scores: IntentA (0.70), IntentB (0.60), IntentC (0.50). The response from the PostText operation would be:   AMAZON.FallbackIntent   IntentA   IntentB   IntentC
    ///   - processBehavior: If you set the processBehavior element to BUILD, Amazon Lex builds the bot so that it can be run. If you set the element to SAVE Amazon Lex saves the bot, but doesn't build it.  If you don't specify this value, the default value is BUILD.

    ///   - enumerationValues: A list of EnumerationValue objects that defines the values that the slot type can take. Each value can have a list of synonyms, which are additional values that help train the machine learning model about the values that it resolves for a slot.  A regular expression slot type doesn't require enumeration values. All other slot types require a list of enumeration values. When Amazon Lex resolves a slot value, it generates a resolution list that contains up to five possible values for the slot. If you are using a Lambda function, this resolution list is passed to the function. If you are not using a Lambda function you can choose to return the value that the user entered or the first value in the resolution list as the slot value. The valueSelectionStrategy field indicates the option to use.
    ///   - name: The name of the slot type. The name is not case sensitive.  The name can't match a built-in slot type name, or a built-in slot type name with "AMAZON." removed. For example, because there is a built-in slot type called AMAZON.DATE, you can't create a custom slot type called DATE. For a list of built-in slot types, see Slot Type Reference in the Alexa Skills Kit.
    ///   - parentSlotTypeSignature: The built-in slot type used as the parent of the slot type. When you define a parent slot type, the new slot type has all of the same configuration as the parent. Only AMAZON.AlphaNumeric is supported.
    ///   - slotTypeConfigurations: Configuration information that extends the parent built-in slot type. The configuration is added to the settings for the parent slot type.
    ///   - valueSelectionStrategy: Determines the slot resolution strategy that Amazon Lex uses to return slot type values. The field can be set to one of the following values:    ORIGINAL_VALUE - Returns the value entered by the user, if the user value is similar to the slot value.    TOP_RESOLUTION - If there is a resolution list for the slot, return the first value in the resolution list as the slot type value. If there is no resolution list, null is returned.
