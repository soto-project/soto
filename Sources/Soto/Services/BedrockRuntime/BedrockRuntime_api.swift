    ///   - modelId: The unique identifier of the model to invoke to run inference. The modelId to provide depends on the type of model that you use:   If you use a base model, specify the model ID or its ARN. For a list of model IDs for base models, see Amazon Bedrock base model IDs (on-demand throughput) in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.   If you use a provisioned model, specify the ARN of the Provisioned Throughput. For more information, see Run inference using a Provisioned Throughput in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.   If you use a custom model, first purchase Provisioned Throughput for it. Then specify the ARN of the resulting provisioned model. For more information, see Use a custom model in Amazon Bedrock in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.   If you use an imported model, specify the ARN of the imported model. You can get the model ARN from a successful call to CreateModelImportJob or from the Imported models page in the Amazon Bedrock console.
