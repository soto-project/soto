/// Service object for interacting with AWS DirectConnect service.
///
/// Direct Connect links your internal network to an Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable.  One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an Direct Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the Amazon Web Services Cloud (for example, to Amazon EC2  and Amazon S3) and to Amazon VPC, bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. A  connection provides access to all Amazon Web Services Regions except the China (Beijing) and (China) Ningxia Regions.  Amazon Web Services resources in the China Regions can only be accessed through locations associated with those Regions.
